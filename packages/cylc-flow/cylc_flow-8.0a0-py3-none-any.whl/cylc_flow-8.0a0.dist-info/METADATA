Cylc (“silk”) orchestrates complex distributed suites of interdependent cycling
(or non-cycling) tasks. It was originally designed to automate environmental
forecasting systems at [NIWA](https://www.niwa.co.nz). Cylc is a general
workflow engine, however; it is not specialized to forecasting in any way.

### Python 2 or Python 3 ?

Currently in the source code repository:
 - **master branch:** Python 3, ZeroMQ network layer, **no GUI** -  **Cylc-8 Work In Progress**
 - **7.8.x branch:** Python 2, Cherrypy network layer, PyGTK GUI - **Cylc-7 Maintenance**

The first official Cylc-8 release (with a new web UI) is not expected until late 2019.
Until then we recommend the latest cylc-7.8 release for production use.
