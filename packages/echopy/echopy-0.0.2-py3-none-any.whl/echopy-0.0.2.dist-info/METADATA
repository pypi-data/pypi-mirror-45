## Introduction

Echopy is a multipurpose library containing common algorithms for
fisheries acoustic data processing including: noise removal; binning;
seabed detection; and target detection. The library provides building
blocks that can be assembled for a variety of fisheries acoustics
applications and is aimed towards unsupervised, automatic and large-scale analyses.

## Background

Echopy was created by [Alejandro Ariza](https://github.com/alejandro-ariza) at the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/) as part of the project [RapidKrill](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/rapidkrill), which aims to build an automatic system to deliver acustic-based krill estimates from fishing vessels. The project was coordinated by [Sophie Fielding](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/sof/) with contributions from [Robert Blackwell](https://github.com/RobBlackwell), both members of the BAS-acoustics team. Due to its flexible structure,  echopy now aims to be a general purpose library for a variety of acoustic processing routines and welcomes acousticians from around the world to get involved.

## Contributing

Echopy is in its early stages, having implemented only a small part of the countless processing and analysis routines in fisheries acoustics. There is still much to do, and we encourage acousticians to audit the code, provide advice, and implement new algorithms.

If contributing, please read [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) to adhere to our coding style.

We also provide a [telegram channel](https://t.me/echopy_group) where beginners can find support, and experts can bring ideas and constructive criticism.

## Prerequisites

Echopy requires Python 3.6.

Echopy is usually used in conjunction with [PyEcholab2](https://github.com/CI-CMG/PyEcholab2). PyEcholab is used
to read RAW files and echopy applies common fisheries acoustic data processing techniques. 

In addition, echopy uses the following packages
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting echograms.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for large, multi-dimensional arrays.
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) for scientific computing.
* [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/) for configuration files.
* [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) for image processing.
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) for image processing.
