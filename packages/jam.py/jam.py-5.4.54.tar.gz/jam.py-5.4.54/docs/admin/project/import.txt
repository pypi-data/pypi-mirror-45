Import
======

Use this button to import project metadata from zip file.

When you click the "Import" button, 
:doc:`Application builder </admin/index>`
opens a Dialog to select a file to be imported.

After the file is selected, the Application builder uploads it to the server and 
sends the server a request to import it.

The server while importing the metadata performs the following operations:

* checks the data integrity - items with the same ID must have the same 
  type and the same table_name attribute if one is specified for an item

* analizes the metadata to generate sql queries to update the project 
  database structure and records of the *admin.sqlite* database

* waits for 5 minits or until all previous request to the server will be processed

* starts to execute sql statments to update the project database.

* if an error occurs while updating the project database, for databases, that 
  support DDL statment rollback (Postgress, Firebird, MSSQL), rollbacks changes, stops the 
  import process and returns the import log to the Application builder. 
  If the database do not support DDL statment rollback (MySql, Oracle) writes error 
  to the import log and continues until all statments will be processed
  
* Commits changes to the project database if it supports DDL statment rollback 
  and modifies the records of the *admin.sqlite*
  
* Copies all the files from zip file to the project folder

* Rebuilds the task on the server

* Send the import log to the Application builder
  
.. note::
    It is strongly recommended that you make a backup of the project database 
    and *admin.sqlite* before performing the import.
    
.. note::

    For **SQLite** database, Jam.py doesnâ€™t support importing of metadata into an 
    existing project (project with tables in the database). 
    You can only import metadata into a new project.
