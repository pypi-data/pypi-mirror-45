    Kubernetes for fedora-atomic runs in system containers [1]. These
    containers are stored in ostree in the fedora-atomic hosts and they don't
    require docker to be running. Pulling and storing them in ostree is very
    fast and they can easily be managed as systemd services. Since these
    containers are based on fedora packages, they are working as drop in
    replacements of the binaries in the fedora atomic host. The ProjectAtomic
    hasn't found a solution yet [3] on tagging the images, so the magnum team
    builds and publishes images in this [2] account in dockerhub. Users can
    select the tag they want using the `kube_tag` label.

    Add swarm-mode driver based on fedora-atomic. Users can select the
    swarm-mode COE by using the `coe` field in cluster-template. This is a new
    driver, it is recommended to let magnum create a private-network and
    security groups per cluster.
