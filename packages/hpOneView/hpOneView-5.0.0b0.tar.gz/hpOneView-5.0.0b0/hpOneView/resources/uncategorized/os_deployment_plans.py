        Retrieves the list of registered Os Deployment plans.

        Args:
            start:
                The first item to return, using 0-based indexing.
                If not specified, the default is 0 - start with the first available item.
            count:
                The number of resources to return. A count of -1 requests all items.
                The actual number of items in the response might differ from the requested
                count if the sum of start and count exceeds the total number of items.
            filter (list or str):
                A general filter/query string to narrow the list of items returned. The
                default is no filter; all resources are returned.
            query:
                 A general query string to narrow the list of resources returned. The default
                 is no query - all resources are returned.
            sort:
                The sort order of the returned data set. By default, the sort order is based
                on create time with the oldest entry first.

        Returns:
