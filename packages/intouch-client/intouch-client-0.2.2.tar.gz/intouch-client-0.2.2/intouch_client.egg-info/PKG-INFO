Description: # intouch-client
        
        Python client library for **Intergas InTouch-compatible boilers** accesible via a **Lan2RF gateway**. It includes a basic CLI to demonstrate how to use the library.
        
        ### Porting from syncio libraries
        This library is based upon https://github.com/bwesterb/incomfort, but uses **aiohttp** rather than synchronous I/O (such as **requests** or **httplib**).
        
        Where possible, it uses uses the same methods and properties as **incomfort**, but with the following differences:
        
          Classes:
          - `InTouchGateway` renamed from Gateway
            - added kwargs: `username`, `password` (used for later versions of firmware)
        
          - `InTouchHeater` renamed from Heater
            - renamed: `is_burning`, `is_failed`, `is_pumping`, `is_tapping`
            - moved out: `room_temp`, `setpoint`, `setpoint_override`, `set`
            - new/added: `update`, `status`, `rooms`
        
          - `InTouchRoom` has been added, and some methods moved in from Heater
            - same name: `room_temp`, `setpoint`
            - renamed: `override`, `set_override`
            - new/added: `status`
