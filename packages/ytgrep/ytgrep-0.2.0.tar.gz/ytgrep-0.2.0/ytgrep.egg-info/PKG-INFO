Description: ytgrep
        -----------------------
        
        ytgrep is a CLI tool to search youtube closed captions with a grep-like interface.
        
        
        Requirements
        =============
        
        * Requires python >= 3.5
        
        Installation
        =============
        .. code:: bash
            
            pip install ytgrep
        
        Purpose
        =============
        ytgrep is particularly useful whilst looking for particular topic or keywords in a video. For example, suppose you are 
        interested in learning more about Breadth First Search. Rather than watching MIT Open Courseware's entire 50 minute video,
        you can do the following with ytgrep:
        
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python ytgrep.py 'bfs' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-CYnVz-uh4
            [00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:24.170] compute this shortest we compute this path out of bfs which is follow a parent
            [00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:24.180] path out of bfs which is follow a parent
            [00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.450] path out of bfs which is follow a parent of v is c prime of c is x parent of x is
            [00:47:25.799 --> 00:47:28.459] the shortest path thats the cool thing about bfs yeah bfs explores of vertices"
        
        Usage
        ==============
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            usage: ytgrep.py [-h] [-e] [-v] [-links] pattern urls [urls ...]
        
        Flags
        =============
        * -e <PATTERN> - specify a regular expression to match
        * -v - verbose, print debug information
        * -links - include the time shortcut link with each match (see example below) 
        
        
        More examples

        Development
        =============
        
        Run Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        *Note:* Functional tests do download directly from Youtube
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           ## All tests
           python -m unittest discover
        
           ## Unit tests
           python -m unittest discover test/unit
        
           ## Functional tests
           python -m unittest discover test/functional
        
        Related projects
        ==================
         * youtube-closed-captions - This project used this library as a starting point https://github.com/mkly/youtube-closed-captions
         * videogrep - get supercuts of video matching provided seach terms
            
        
        TODO
        ============
        * Supporting languages other than English
        * -e '*' breaks ytgrep - appears to be applying red more than once
        * Run coverage and see if any tests are missing
