Description: # Fuzzy Matcher
        
        A super simple MIT licensed fuzzy matching library to be used as an MIT alternative to Fuzzy Wuzzy which is GPL licensed.
        It is much less featured as Fuzzy Wuzzy, so if GPL is not blocking you, you should probably use Fuzzy Wuzzy instead.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from fuzzy_matcher import process
        query = "orange"
        val = ['blue', 'orange', 'brown', 'ornage', 'range', 'angel', 'gang', 'ang']
        fuzzy = process.extract(query, val, limit=3, scorer='ratio')
        ```
        
        should output:
        ```python
        [('orange', 100), ('range', 83), ('ornage', 66)]
        ```
        
        ### Supported scorers
        
        Only `ratio` and `partial_ratio` are supported at this time.
        Note that scores will not be the same as FuzzyWuzzy's.
