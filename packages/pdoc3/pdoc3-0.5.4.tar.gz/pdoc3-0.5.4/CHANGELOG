0.5.4
=====
  - Bugfixes:
    - Added support for metaclass subclasses.
    - Fix pdoc.Function.params() error in case when keyword-only
      parameters have no default values.
    - Don't expand `os.environ` parameter default value as exposing it
      is a security issue.

0.5.3
=====
  - Only close standard input if `--close-stdin` is used. This flips
    the previous (hopefully rarely required) default.
  - Fix backslashes in relative `Doc.url()` on Windos.
  - New support for `.. include::` reST directive that includes
    verbatim content from another file.
  - Dev web server (`--http`) fixes:
    - Unify `--http` and non-`--http` behavior by always adding
      cwd to `sys.path`.
    - Fix favicon.ico errors in `--http` mode.
  - HTML template:
    - Make TOC reference lists two- or three-column only if enough room for it.
    - Fix: Hyperlink raw URLs.
    - New optional sorting of variables, functions, classes.
    - New configurable Highlight.js style.

0.5.2
=====
  - Add `__main__.py` so users can invoke `python -m pdoc`.
  - Fix: List builtin class method descriptors
  - Google docstring format fixes:
    - Support for 2-space indents.
    - Recognize sections even when not preceded by an empty line.
    - Recognize additional characters (`,=[]`) in type specifications.
  - HTML template fixes:
    - Fixed some CSS typos.
    - Re-styled View Source button in HTML template.
    - Two-column TOC reference lists only when all names are short.
    - TOC links for some class no longer lead to its ancestor class.

0.5.1
=====
  - Markdown >= 3.0.0 requirement.

0.5.0
=====
  - Relicensed as AGPL-3.0.
  - Major refactoring, Python 3 compatibility.
  - Support Numpydoc, Google-style docstrings, and some reST directives.
  - CLI changes:
    - Specifying modules/packages to document if mandatory.
    - Identifier filtering can be turned on with an optional `--filter`
      argument.
    - Argument `--all-submodules` is removed.
    - To avoid polluting the python package with scattered *.html files,
      the default `--html-dir` now points to `./html`.
    - Arguments `--http-host` and `--http-port` are removed in favor
      of passing a parameter to argument `--http`.
    - Program errors if specified template directory is invalid.
  - All document objects have a `.obj` property, pointing to the raw
    Python object.
  - Major template updates:
    - Template exceptions are propagated to stderr.
    - Major refactoring (modern HTML5) of the HTML template.
    - HTML template loads Normalize.css and Highlight.js from CDN.
    - HTML template output is minified.
    - HTML template includes sub-templates (config.mako, head.mako, logo.mako,
      credits.mako) to more easily adapt it.
    - In HTML template, module headings are extracted into sidebar TOC.
  - `Function.params()` returns only public parameters.
  - To disable documenting an identifier with `__pdoc__`, prefer `False`
    to `None` (deprecated).

0.3.1
=====
  - Source code is extracted from __wrapped__ if it exists, and then
    falls back to inspect.getsourcelines. This reverses the behavior
    implemented in #6.
  - Fix Python 2.6 compatibility by requiring Markdown < 2.5 (#19).
    Markdown 2.5 dropped support for Python 2.6.
  - Get rid of tabs that sneaked in from #17.
  - Fix pep8 violations.

0.3.0
=====
  - Major HTML face lift. Kudos to @knadh!
    (PR: https://github.com/BurntSushi/pdoc/pull/17)

0.2.4
=====
  - Fixed bug in HTTP server that was referencing a non-existent
    variable.

0.2.3
=====
  - Fixed #10 (the --template-dir flag now works).

0.2.2
=====
  - Fixes #7 by ignoring module loaders that lack a 'path' attribute.

0.2.1
=====
  - Fixes #5 by trying to find source for decorated functions.

0.2.0
=====
  - Fix issue #2 by making pdoc a package instead of a module.
    The templates are now included as package_data, which seems
    to be more portable (its final location is more predictable).

0.1.8
=====
  - pdoc now interprets `__pdoc__[key] = None` as an explicit way
    to hide `key` from the public interface of its module.

0.1.7
=====
  - Removed __new__ from the public interface. I think __init__
    is sufficient.

0.1.6
=====
  - Fixed bug #1.

0.1.5
=====
  - Fixed a bug with an improper use of getattr.
  - Made pdoc aware of __slots__. (Every identifier in __slots__
    is automatically interpreted as an instance variable.)

0.1.4
=====
  - Fixed bug where getargspec wasn't being used in Python 2.x.

0.1.3
=====
  - Avoid a FQDN lookup.

0.1.2
=====
  - A few doco touchups.
  - Fixed a bug in Py3K. Use getfullargspec when available.

0.1.1
=====
  - Documentation touch ups.
  - Removed unused command line flags.

0.1.0
=====
First public release.
