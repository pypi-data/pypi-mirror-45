Hello!

I'm pleased to announce version 3.7.2, the second bugfix release of branch
3.7 of SQLObject.


What's new in SQLObject
=======================

Minor features
--------------

* Adapt Postgres exception handling to ``psycopg2`` version ``2.8``:
  in the recent ``psycopg2`` errors are in ``psycopg2.errors`` module.

* Removed RdbhostConnection: David Keeney and rdbhost seem to be unavailable
  since 2017.

For a more complete list, please see the news:

What is SQLObject
=================

SQLObject is an object-relational mapper.  Your database tables are described
as classes, and rows are instances of those classes.  SQLObject is meant to be
easy to use and quick to get started with.

SQLObject supports a number of backends: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB (also known as SAPDB).

Python 2.7 or 3.4+ is required.

Example
=======

Create a simple class that wraps a table::

  >>> from sqlobject import *
  >>>
  >>> sqlhub.processConnection = connectionForURI('sqlite:/:memory:')
  >>>
  >>> class Person(SQLObject):
  ...     fname = StringCol()
  ...     mi = StringCol(length=1, default=None)
  ...     lname = StringCol()
  ...
  >>> Person.createTable()

Use the object::

  >>> p = Person(fname="John", lname="Doe")
  >>> p
  <Person 1 fname='John' mi=None lname='Doe'>
  >>> p.fname
  'John'
  >>> p.mi = 'Q'
  >>> p2 = Person.get(1)
  >>> p2
  <Person 1 fname='John' mi='Q' lname='Doe'>
  >>> p is p2
  True

Queries::

  >>> p3 = Person.selectBy(lname="Doe")[0]
  >>> p3
  <Person 1 fname='John' mi='Q' lname='Doe'>
  >>> pc = Person.select(Person.q.lname=="Doe").count()
  >>> pc
  1
