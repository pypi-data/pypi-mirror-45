Description: # PreviewGen
        
        PreviewGen is a tool for generating previews from photo galleries at source location. Previews are created in target location where the source structure is copied but images are replaced with compressed and resized copy. Basic idea is to provide a preview of a full size gallery with a reasonable size and quality.
        
        ## Instalation
        
        PreviewGen is deployed to pypi and can be therefore easily installed using pip.
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install previewgen
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        After installation preview-gen command should be available from command line.
        
        ```sh
        $ preview-gen
        usage: preview-gen [-h] config_file
        ```
        
        ### Config file
        
        ```yaml
        # example config file conf.yaml
        
        scanner:
          source_dir: /Users/mfilippi/pg-test/s
          destination_dir: /Users/mfilippi/pg-test/d
        
        previewer:
          max_width: 1000
          max_height: 1000
          quality: 80
        
        # optional logger config
        logger:
          # posible levels can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels
          level: DEBUG
        ```
        
        In the same directory the tool can be executed using `$ preview-gen conf.yaml`.
