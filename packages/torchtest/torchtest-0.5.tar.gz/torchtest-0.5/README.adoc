= torchtest

A Tiny Test Suite for pytorch based Machine Learning models, inspired by https://github.com/Thenerdstation/mltest/blob/master/mltest/mltest.py[mltest]. 
Chase Roberts lists out 4 basic tests in his https://medium.com/@keeper6928/mltest-automatically-test-neural-network-models-in-one-function-call-eb6f1fa5019d[medium post] about mltest. 
torchtest is mostly a pytorch port of mltest(which was written for tensorflow).

== Installation

[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade torchtest
----

== Tests


[source, python]
----
# imports for examples
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.autograd import Variable

=== Variables Change

[source, python]
----

inputs = Variable(torch.randn(20, 20))
targets = Variable(torch.randint(0, 2, (20,))).long()
batch = [inputs, targets]

# what are the variables?
print('Our list of parameters', [ np[0] for np in model.named_parameters() ])

# do they change after a training step?
#  let's run a train step and see

=== Variables Don't Change

[source, python]
----
from torchtest import assert_vars_same

# What if bias is not supposed to change, by design?
#  test to see if bias remains the same after training

=== Output Range

=== NaN Tensors
