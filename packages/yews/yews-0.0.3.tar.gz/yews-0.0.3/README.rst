Yews is a deep learning toolbox for processing seismic waveform made with flexibility, speed, and usability in mind. It is built upon `PyTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`_ for researchers interested in applying deep learning techniques on seismic waveform data.



Installation
============

It is recommened to first install `PyTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`_ using the offical guide: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ . Then, install `Yews <https://github.com/lijunzh/yews>`_ via one of the following approaches:

conda:

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c lijunzhu -c pytorch yews


pip:

.. code:: bash

   pip install yews


From source:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install


Note:

1. These assume that you have PyTorch installed via the default method.

2. If, however, yews is installed without going through the official PyTorch installation, it will still be installed properly using the pip method

3. The lateset PyTorch 1.0.1 has been manually uploaded to lijunzhu channel on anaconda cloud, which makes it possible to install PyTorch automatically as a dependency using the conda method. However, it does not support older PyTorch versions for now. Future updates of PyTorch will be added ASAP.

4. Yews can be installed via *conda-forge* with all dependencies handled automatically; however, it only supports the **CPU** version as *PyTorch* does not have a **GPU** version for the conda-forge channel.



Documentation
=============
