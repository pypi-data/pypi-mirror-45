Storage engines.

All persistent storage in `jacquard` is handled through pluggable,
transactional key-value stores. These see only occasional writes
but very heavy read load.

The system is pluggable, and new engines can be added by adding entry points
under the `jacquard.storage_engines` group.

Four engines are provided with jacquard:

dummy
  Keeps configuration in memory. Pretty useless outside of unit tests.

file
  SQLite3-based file storage. A sane default when running Jacquard on a
  single machine. Not hugely performant, but doesn't need to be! Also
  occasionally useful as a transport format.

redis
  Redis key-value backing. A next step when scaling up Jacquard. Requires
  little tinkering to be able to run in multi-machine setups.
