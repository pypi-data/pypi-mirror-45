requests-safe
-------------

This project provides an ``HTTPAdapter`` for the Requests_ library that will
disallow connections to networks that are considered unsafe to connect to.

The primary use case is to safely be able to retrieve items from a user
provided URL without potentially requesting internal or secret resources within
ones own network.

Usage
~~~~~

It's very simple to use this library, install it as part of your project and
then the following code will protect all requests against accidentally
retrieving something from an IP address in the ranges listed below!

.. code:: python

    import requests_safe
    from requests import Session

    with Session() as s:
        requests_safe.apply(s)

        s.get("https://google.com/")

There is unfortunately no global way to apply this, so using ``requests.get()``
and friends directly will not be protected by default.

IPv4 unsafe networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the IPv4 networks that are blocked from being conneted to:
