Description: Welcome to pytest-split-tests!
        ==============================
        
        pytest-split-tests allows you to split your test runs into groups of a specific
        size to make it easier to split up your test runs.
        
        
        Usage
        ---------------------
        
        ::
        
            # Install pytest-split-tests
            pip install pytest-split-tests
        
            # Split the tests into 10 groups and run the second group
            py.test --test-group-count 10 --test-group=2
            
            # Assign tests pseudo-randomly into 10 groups, and run the second group
            py.test --test-group-count 10 --test-group=2 --test-group-random-seed=12345
        
        
        Why would I use this?
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Sometimes you may have some long running test jobs that take a
        while to complete. This can be a major headache when trying to
        run tests quickly. pytest-split-tests allows you to easily say
        "split my tests into groups of 10 tests and run the second group".
        This is primarily useful in the context of CI builds.
