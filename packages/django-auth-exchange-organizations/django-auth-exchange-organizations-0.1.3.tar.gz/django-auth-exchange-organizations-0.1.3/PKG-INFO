        ###########################
        
        Source: https://github.com/gregschmit/django-auth-exchange-organizations
        
        PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/django-auth-exchange-organizations/
        
        Auth Exchange Organizations is an extension to Auth Exchange
        (https://github.com/gregschmit/django-auth-exchange) that allows
        users/domains to be associated to Organizations from
        :code:`django-organizations`.
        
        
        How to Use
        ==========
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ pip install django-auth-exchange-organizations
        
        Include :code:`django_auth_exchange_organizations` in your
        :code:`INSTALLED_APPS`.
        
        You can create associations by creating DomainOrganization objects in the Admin
        UI. You'll need to configure :code:`django-auth-exchange` before you can test
        this app out.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        :code:`AUTH_EXCHANGE_ORGS_AUTOASSOCIATE` (default: :code:`True`) - Whether
        organization association should be automatic.
        
        :code:`AUTH_EXCHANGE_ORGS_AUTO_CREATE_ORGS` (default: :code:`True`) - Whether
        organizations/associations should be created if they don't exist.
