# Sample Random Variables Python Package

## Installations
Because this is a Python package

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this project was to gain experience with how Python packages are structured, writing my own Python package, learning how to install my own package locally, and finally, understanding how to upload a package to PyPI for public release. 

## File Descriptions

## Summary

## Authors
Most of what's in this package/repo is written by me. Some inspiration was taken from content from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, where the example package is written on a library containing random variable distribution classes.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Udacity for including this optional project as part of their Data Scientist Nanodegree, which allowed me to gain some experience with writing my own Python package, installing, and uploading it to PyPI. Thanks to NumPy for providing some great random variable generation functions that I used :)
