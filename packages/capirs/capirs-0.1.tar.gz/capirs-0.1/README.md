Counter Adversarial Package for Image Recognition Systems - Senior Design LA Tech Winter - Spring 2019

# First Commit
full_code.py is based on the tutorial https://www.anishathalye.com/2017/07/25/synthesizing-adversarial-examples/

The other source code files are just a modularization of that code (plus or minus some parts).

# Prerequisites
Python 3.6
TenserFlow, open-source machine learning to model the neural network
Pillow, fork of the Python Imaging Library
Numpy for vector math and image modifications
Scipy for spatial vector mathematics and adversarial comparisons
Matplotlib for MATLAB plots
Facial_recognition for face recognition testing (https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)

# Installing
No installation required, just create a script and run it using Python 3.6, importing and using whatever files you need
