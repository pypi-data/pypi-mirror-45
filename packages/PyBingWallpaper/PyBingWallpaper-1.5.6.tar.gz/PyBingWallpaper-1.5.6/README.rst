============

With installer (Windows Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing with the installer is recommended for Windows users unless. Installers can be downloaded from `project website`_.

With PIP
~~~~~~~~

**NOTE** To install pybingwallpaper in Windows with PIP, it's highly recommended to install the `precompiled Pillow <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow>`_ in advance since install it from PIP could be cumbersome.

::

  pip install -U PyBingWallpaper

To install the development version, use::

  pip install -U git+https://github.com/genzj/pybingwallpaper.git

**NOTE** For Windows users, the setter must be copied into the folder containing ``BingWallpaper.exe``, normally named ``Scripts`` in Python installation path or virtual-env path. E.g. assuming the PyBingWallpaper is installed under virtualenv ``.\venv``, the `winsetter.py`_ must be downloaded to the ``.\venv\Scripts`` folder.
