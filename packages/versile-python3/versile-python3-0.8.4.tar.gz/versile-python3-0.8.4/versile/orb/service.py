    :type  conf:         :class:`VServiceConfig`
    :raises:             :exc:`VLinkError`

    Other arguments are similar to :class:`versile.orb.link.VLink`\ .

    .. note::

        Copyleft license information must be globally configured for
        Versile Python on :class:`versile.Versile` before a service
        can be established.

    .. note::

        Some of the arguments are not used by all service protocols,
        e.g.  *key*, *identity* and *certificates* are not used by the
        VTP protocol, and are ignored.

    *gw_factory* is a :class:`versile.orb.service.VGatewayFactory` or
    similar factory method, which returns either a
    :class:`versile.orb.entity.VObject` gateway object, or a tuple of
    a gateway object and a gateway callback method (callable) for when
    the link is activated. If *gw_factory* is None then
    :meth:`_create_gw` is used as the factory (which must then be
    overloaded in a derived class).

    *auth* is passed to links constructed by the service, see
    :class:`versile.orb.link.VLink` for information about its use.

    If a *p_auth* authorizer is provided, accept_host (only)
    validation is performed in sockets produced by a factory
    created by :meth:`_create_factory`\ .

    If *sock* is provided, it must be already bound and set
    listening. An already bound *sock* will override any configuration
    setting for interface or port number.  If *sock* is None, a
    default socket is created and bound.

    If *node* is provided then the service is being controlled and may
    only accept a new connection and initiate a new link when
    authorized by the controlled. The service registers itself with
    the node during construction by calling
    :meth:`VServiceNode.register_service`\ . If *node* is None then
    the service is not being controlled and accepts any incoming
    connections.

    If *internal* is True then buffer sizes in the consumer/producer
    chain of client sockets are set to
    :attr:`DEFAULT_INT_LINK_BUFSIZE`\ , otherwise the socket and
    entity channel defaults are used. If *buf_size* is set then it is
    used as buffer size, regardless of the value of *internal*.

    .. note::

        The difference between *auth* and *p_auth* is *auth* acts on
        the link layer and interacts with settings on a link's call
        context object, whereas *p_auth* acts on the lower
        communication layers.

    When a link is instantiated, it should be instantiated with a deep
    copy of *conf.link_config* as the link's configuration.

    When started, the service will accept incoming connections and
    instantiate a link on each new client connection.

    As per :term:`VOL` protocol specifications, global copyleft
    license information must be set to be used in link handshakes. See
    :class:`versile.Versile` for information. If copyleft license
    information has not been globally configured, :exc:`VLinkError` is
    raised, because the service would not be able to establish links
    for incoming connections.

    This is an abstract class that should not be directly instantiated.

        Returns a set of nodes which should be authorized to accept a
        client connection (if any). Any returned nodes will receive a
        call to :meth:`VCallNode.can_accept` authorizing a connection.

        This method is called internally after a node was added or
        after a notification that a node client connection was
        accepted or closed.

        The default implementation returns a set with a single node
        which is the node with the fewest current client connections,
        except if max connections or max node connection limit
        capacities set on the controller have been exceeded then an
        empty set is returned. Derived classes can override.  the
