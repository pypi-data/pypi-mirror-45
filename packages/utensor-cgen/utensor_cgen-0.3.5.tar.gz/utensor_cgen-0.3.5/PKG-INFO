          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description: # Installation (Python 2 & 3)
        
        ## For Users
        
        - with `setup.py`
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        - with `pip`
        ```
        pip install utensor_cgen
        ```
        
        ## For Developers:
        
        - with `pip`
        ```
        pip install -e .[dev]
        ```
        
        - with `pipenv`
            1. `$ PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 pipenv install -d`
            2. `$ pipenv shell`
                - this will spawn a subshell and activate the virtual environment for you
                - You should be able to use the cli now  
        
        You can go to this [repo](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for detail information about `pipenv`.
        
        ### Troubleshooting with `pipenv`
        
        - If you have trouble with installation using `pipenv`, try `PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 pipenv install -d --skip-lock`
        - there is known issue of `pip` and `pipenv`, plz refer to this [issue](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2924) for detail
            - short answer: downgrade to `pip==18.0` may help :)
        - Tensorflow requires `setuptools<=39.1.0` (the latest is `40.4.3` by the time this README is writen)
            - plz downgrade to `setuptools==39.1.0`
            - my recommendation is to use `virtualenv`

        # Basic Usage
        
        ## `utensor-cli show <model.pb>`
        
        Show all nodes and detailed information of given pb file.
        
        Run `utensor-cli show --help` for detailed information.
        
        ## `utensor-cli convert --output-nodes=<node_name>[,<node_name>,...] <model.pb>`
        
        Convert given pb file into cpp/hpp files.
        
        Note that `--output-nodes` is required options. It's the names of nodes you want to output, seperated by comma if there are many.
        
        In graph theory terminology, they are `leaf` nodes of your graph.
        
        Run `utensor-cli convert --help` for detailed information.
        
        # Example
        
        Please refer to [tests/deep_mlp](https://github.com/uTensor/utensor_cgen/tree/develop/tests/deep_mlp) for detailed example
        
        # User Guide
        
        Following steps are a general guild for user how to porting a `TensorFlow` protobuf file into a `uTensor` implementation:
        
        1. install `utensor_cgent`
            - run `python3 setupt.py install`
        2. run `utensor-cli convert --output-nodes='NODE,NODE,...' graph.pb`
            - run `utensor-cli -h` for help
            - the `graph.pb` is the pb file of *original* graph (not quantized)
        3. If you want to see what ops/nodes are in the pb file, you can run `utensor-cli show <pbfile>`
        
        # How to test (for Developer)
        
        1. follow the steps in [setup](#setup-with-pipenv) section
        2. run `make tests`
            - Or you can use `pipenv run pytest tests` instead
        
        # Known Limitations
        
        - If you want to use dropout with placeholders for the `keep_prob`, you have to name the `keep_prob` placeholder by any name that starts with "keep_prob".
            - You can still use any input tensor with name starts with "keep_prob" as long as it's not the output tensor of a placeholder node.
            - You can't wrap `dropout` in any `namescope`

        # TODOs
        1. (done?) core code generator implementation
            - We need some refactoring, PRs are welcomed!
        2. type alias in C/C++
            - ex: use `uint8_t` or `unsigned char`?
            - a lot more about this.... 
        3. Relation among snippets/containers
            - shared template variables? (headers, shared placeholders...etc)
        4. Better configuration schema
            - json
            - yaml
            - or ?
