Data Smashing
-------------

FIXME
-----

* "produce" doesn't work on new data (unsupervised)
* code runs slowly (quantizer needs to be more efficient?)
* SIPPL embedding returns wrong number of examples
* perhaps shouldn't write out libs (and then delete them) during runs
* fix "compute resources"
* get "seed" dataset that's actually applicable
* why is data smash embedding/featurization running so quickly in example scripts?
* why is data smash in general running so slowly in pipeline scripts?
* bring up to 3.6 typing standard


TODO
----

* add license
* add read\_series to set\_training\_data methods
* allow user input for partition\_list
* cuda functionality
* give option to call other primitives
