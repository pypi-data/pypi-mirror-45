[TOC]

especially when you find out only after an invest of time and energy.

Documentation is often prone to produce such situations, since hard to keep
100% in sync with the code evolution.

# Isolation

None. If you would screw up your host running pytest normally, then you will
get the same result, when running markdown generating tests.


[Here](https://github.com/axiros/pycond) is a bigger tutorial,
[created][dasrc] from `pytest2md`. There you'll learn in addition to shell
runners how to generate markdown from running inline python functions...
