S1_SAR_OCN:
  desc: |
    Level-2 OCN products include components for Ocean Swell spectra (OSW) providing continuity with ERS and ASAR WV
    and two new components: Ocean Wind Fields (OWI) and Surface Radial Velocities (RVL).
    The OSW is a two-dimensional ocean surface swell spectrum and includes an estimate of the wind speed and direction
    per swell spectrum. The OSW is generated from Stripmap and Wave modes only. For Stripmap mode, there are multiple
    spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette.
    The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface
    derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes.
    The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated
    geometrical Doppler.

S1_SAR_GRD:
  desc: |
    Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and
    projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model. Phase information is lost. The resulting product has
    approximately square spatial resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle at the cost of worse
    spatial resolution.
    GRD products can be in one of three resolutions:
      Full Resolution (FR),
      High Resolution (HR),
      Medium Resolution (MR).
    The resolution is dependent upon the amount of multi-looking performed. Level-1 GRD products are available in MR
    and HR for IW and EW modes, MR for WV mode and MR, HR and FR for SM mode.

S1_SAR_SLC:
  desc: |
    Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products consist of focused SAR data geo-referenced using orbit and attitude
    data from the satellite and provided in zero-Doppler slant-range geometry. The products include a single look in
    each dimension using the full transmit signal bandwidth and consist of complex samples preserving the phase
    information.

S1_SAR_RAW:
  desc: |
    The SAR Level-0 products consist of the sequence of Flexible Dynamic Block Adaptive Quantization (FDBAQ) compressed
    unfocused SAR raw data. For the data to be usable, it will need to be decompressed and processed using a SAR
    processor.

    The SLSTR Level-2 LST product provides land surface parameters generated on the wide 1 km measurement grid.
    It contains measurement file with Land Surface Temperature (LST) values with associated parameters (LST
    parameters are computed and provided for each pixel (re-gridded or orphan) included in the 1 km measurement grid)

S3_OLCI_L2LRR:
  desc: |
    The OLCI Level-2 Land Reduced Resolution (OL_2_LRR) products contain land and atmospheric geophysical products
    at Reduced resolution with a spatial sampling of approximately 1.2 km. The products are assumed to be computed
    in Near Real Time (NRT) (i.e. delivered to users less than 3 hours after acquisition), in Non-Time Critical
    (NTC) (i.e. within 1 month after acquisition) or in re-processed NTC.

    Time (NRT) (i.e. delivered to users less than 3 hours after acquisition), in Non-Time Critical (NTC) (i.e.
    within 1 month after acquisition) or in re-processed NTC.

S2_MSI_L1C:
  desc: |
    The Level-1C product is composed of 100x100 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). It results from
    using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to project the image in cartographic geometry. Per-pixel radiometric
    measurements are provided in Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances along with the parameters to transform them
    into radiances. Level-1C products are resampled with a constant Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of 10, 20 and 60
    meters depending on the native resolution of the different spectral bands. In Level-1C  products, pixel
    coordinates refer to the upper left corner of the pixel. Level-1C products will additionally include Cloud Masks
    and ECMWF data (total column of ozone, total column of water vapour and mean sea level pressure).

S2_MSI_L2A:

    The Level-2A product provides Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance images derived from the associated Level-1C
    products. Each Level-2A product is composed of 100x100 km2 tiles in cartographic geometry (UTM/WGS84 projection).
