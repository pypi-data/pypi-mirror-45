Installation
------------

Simplest way:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --user dephell[full]

See `installation documentation <https://dephell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for better ways.

Usage
-----

First of all, install DepHell and activate autocomplete:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --user dephell[full]
   dephell autocomplete

Let's get `sampleproject <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject>`_ and make it better.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject.git
   cd sampleproject

This project uses `setup.py <https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html>`_ for dependenciesand metainfo. However, this format over-complicated for most of projects. Let's convert it into `poetry <https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/pyproject/>`_\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   dephell deps convert --from=setup.py --to=pyproject.toml

It will make next ``pyproject.toml``\ :

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.poetry]
   name = "sampleproject"
   version = "1.2.0"
   description = "A sample Python project"
   authors = ["The Python Packaging Authority <pypa-dev@googlegroups.com>"]
   readme = "README.md"

   [tool.poetry.scripts]
   sample = "sample:main"

   [tool.poetry.dependencies]
   python = "!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,<4,>=2.7"
   coverage = {optional = true}
   peppercorn = "*"

   [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
   check-manifest = "*"

   [tool.poetry.extras]
   test = ["coverage"]

Now, let's generate some useful files:

.. code-block:: bash

   dephell generate authors

   dephell generate license MIT

   # https://editorconfig.org/
   dephell generate editorconfig

Our users, probably, has no installed poetry, but they, definitely, has pip that can install files from setup.py. Let's make it easier to generate ``setup.py`` from our ``pyproject.toml``. Also, it points for DepHell your default dependencies file. Add next lines in the ``pyproject.toml``\ :

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.dephell.main]
   from = {format = "poetry", path = "pyproject.toml"}
   to = {format = "setuppy", path = "setup.py"}

You can see full real world example of config in `DepHell's own pyproject.toml <./pyproject.toml>`_.

Now we can call DepHell commands without explicitly specifying ``from`` and ``to``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   dephell deps convert

It will make setup.py and README.rst from pyproject.toml and README.md.

Now let's test our code into virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dephell venv run pytest
   WARNING venv does not exist, creating... (project=/home/gram/Documents/sampleproject, env=main, path=/home/gram/.local/share/dephell/venvs/sampleproject-Whg0/main)
   INFO venv created (path=/home/gram/.local/share/dephell/venvs/sampleproject-Whg0/main)
   WARNING executable does not found in venv, trying to install... (executable=pytest)
   INFO build dependencies graph...
   INFO installation...
   # ... pip output
   # ... pytest output

Also, we can just activate virtual environment for project and run any commands inside:

.. code-block:: bash

   dephell venv shell

Ugh, we has tests, but has no ``pytest`` in our dependencies file. Let's add it:

.. code-block:: bash

   dephell deps add --envs dev test -- pytest

Afer that our dev-dependencies looks like this:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
   check-manifest = "*"
   pytest = "*"

   [tool.poetry.extras]
   test = ["coverage", "pytest"]

One day we will have really many dependencies. Let's have a look how many of them we have now:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dephell deps tree
   - check-manifest [required: *, locked: 0.37, latest: 0.37]
   - coverage [required: *, locked: 4.5.3, latest: 4.5.3]
   - peppercorn [required: *, locked: 0.6, latest: 0.6]
   - pytest [required: *, locked: 4.4.0, latest: 4.4.0]
     - atomicwrites [required: >=1.0, locked: 1.3.0, latest: 1.3.0]
     - attrs [required: >=17.4.0, locked: 19.1.0, latest: 19.1.0]
     - colorama [required: *, locked: 0.4.1, latest: 0.4.1]
     - funcsigs [required: >=1.0, locked: 1.0.2, latest: 1.0.2]
     - more-itertools [required: <6.0.0,>=4.0.0, locked: 5.0.0, latest: 7.0.0]
       - six [required: <2.0.0,>=1.0.0, locked: 1.12.0, latest: 1.12.0]
     - more-itertools [required: >=4.0.0, locked: 7.0.0, latest: 7.0.0]
     - pathlib2 [required: >=2.2.0, locked: 2.3.3, latest: 2.3.3]
       - scandir [required: *, locked: 1.10.0, latest: 1.10.0]
       - six [required: *, locked: 1.12.0, latest: 1.12.0]
     - pluggy [required: >=0.9, locked: 0.9.0, latest: 0.9.0]
     - py [required: >=1.5.0, locked: 1.8.0, latest: 1.8.0]
     - setuptools [required: *, locked: 41.0.0, latest: 41.0.0]
     - six [required: >=1.10.0, locked: 1.12.0, latest: 1.12.0]

Hm... It is many or not? Let's look on their size.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dephell inspect venv --filter=lib_size
   11.96Mb

Ugh... Ok, it's Python. Are they actual?

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dephell deps outdated
   [
     {
       "description": "More routines for operating on iterables, beyond itertools",
       "installed": [
         "5.0.0"
       ],
       "latest": "7.0.0",
       "name": "more-itertools",
       "updated": "2019-03-28"
     },
   ]

``Pytest`` requires old version of ``more-itertools``. That happens.

If our tests and dependencies are OK, it's time to deploy. First of all, increment project version:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dephell project bump minor
   INFO generated new version (old=1.2.0, new=1.3.0)

And then build packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dephell project build
   INFO dumping... (format=setuppy)
   INFO dumping... (format=egginfo)
   INFO dumping... (format=sdist)
   INFO dumping... (format=wheel)
   INFO builded

Now, we can upload these packages on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ with `twine <https://github.com/pypa/twine/>`_.

This is some of the most useful commands. See `documentation <https://dephell.readthedocs.io/>`_ for more details.
