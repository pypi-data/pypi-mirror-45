>This program converts all the comments in your code to a README.md file and saves a lot of your time provided you write comments in your code. It is obvious how easy it is to actually generate the README.md file and save your time.Using the argparse module to get the file path. Note that to run the file
```bash
python -m code2read.code -p <path to file> -o <path to output>
#example
python -m code2read.code -p "setup.py" -o "/Users/lordvile/Downloads/"
```
