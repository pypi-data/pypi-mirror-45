# ReconstructOrder
Reconstruct birefringence, slow axis, bright-field, and degree of polarization from polarization-resolved images. The core algorithm employs Stokes representation for reconstruction and background correction. The repository also provides utilities for batch analysis of multi-dimensional datasets acquired with Micro-Manager (https://micro-manager.org/) and OpenPolScope acquisition plugin (https://openpolscope.org/).

## Installation

### Create a new conda environment (optional, but recommended)
>Install conda package management system by installing anaconda or miniconda (https://conda.io/). 
>Creating a conda environment dedicated to ReconstructOrder will avoid version conflicts among packages required by ReconstructOrder and packages required by other python software.
>
>```buildoutcfg
>conda create -n <your-environment-name> python=3.7
>conda activate <your-environment-name>
>```

#### All code blocks below assume you are in the above environment

### Option 1: install released version via pip
>ReconstructOrder is available on pip.  Running pip install will also install dependencies.
>From your environment created above, type:
>```buildoutcfg
>pip install ReconstructOrder
>```

### Option 2: install developer version via git
>Install the git version control system git : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
>
>Use git to clone this repository to your current directory:
>```buildoutcfg
>git clone https://github.com/czbiohub/ReconstructOrder.git
>```

> * #### install dependencies
>  You have two options to install dependencies: via pip (python index package) or via docker
>
>>  * ##### install dependencies via pip
>>    If you are running ReconstructOrder on your own machine, navigate to the cloned repository 
>>  and install python library dependencies:
>>
>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    pip install -r requirements.txt
>>    ```

>>  * ##### install dependencies via docker
>>
>>    If you are running ReconstructOrder on a compute node (e.g., fry2@czbiohub), it is recommended to run it in 
a Docker container. 
Docker is the virtual environment with all the required libraries pre-installed so you can run your copy of 
ReconstructOrder without recreating the environment.
The docker image for ReconstructOrder has been built on fry2@czbiohub. 
If you are running ReconstructOrder on other servers, you can build the docker image after cloning the repository 
by doing :    

>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    docker build -t reconstruct_order:py37 -f Dockerfile.ReconstructOrder .
>>    ```

>>    Now, to start a docker container, do 
>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    docker run -it  -v /data/<your data dir>/:<data dir name inside docker>/ -v ~/ReconstructOrder:/ReconstructOrder reconstruct_order:py37 bash
>>    ```



## Usage
>To run reconstruction, you will need to create a configuration file.  The configuration file is a .yml file and specifies parameters for:
> * 'dataset'
> * 'processing'
> * 'plotting'
>
> Examples can be found https://github.com/czbiohub/ReconstructOrder under "examples/example_configs" folder
> 
> See /ReconstructOrder/config/config_example.yml for an example config file with detailed explanation of parameters. 
>
> Before running, you should modify the dataset:data_dir and dataset:processed_dir paths to point to source data path and output path, respectively.  Example data is located at examples/example_data 
>
> #### There are two ways to run reconstruction:
>>* #### from command line
>>   If you pip installed the library, from any folder, simply type:
>>   ```buildoutcfg
>>   runReconstruction --config path-and-name-to-your-config.yml
>>   ```
>>
>>   If you cloned the developer repo, navigate to the repo and call the script:
>>   ```buildoutcfg
>>   (C:\ReconstructOrder\) python runReconstruction.py --config path-and-name-to-your-config.yml
>>   ```
>
>>* #### from IPython
>>   If you are writing your own code and want to use the ReconstructOrder library, you can reconstruct as follows:
>>   ```buildoutcfg
>>   import ReconstructOrder.workflow as wf
>>   wf.reconstructBatch('path-and-name-to-your-config.yml')
>>   ```
