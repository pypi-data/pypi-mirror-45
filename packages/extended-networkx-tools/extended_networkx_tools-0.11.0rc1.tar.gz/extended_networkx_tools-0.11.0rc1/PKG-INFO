Description: # Extended networkx Tools
        Python Package for for visualizing and converting networkx graphs.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        This package was created for the purpose of examining bidirectional graphs with respect to its convergence rate and edge costs.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```shell
        pip install extended-networkx-tools
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        [extended-networkx-tools.readthedocs.io](https://extended-networkx-tools.readthedocs.io/)
        
        ## The package
        
        Currently the package contains 3 main modules, `Creator`, `Analytics` and `Visual`.
        
        ### Creator
        
        Contains tools to create networkx graphs based on given parameters, such as randomly 
        create an empty graph based on a number of nodes, or specify precisely the 
        coordinates of nodes and the edges between them.
        
        ### Analytics
        
        Has tools for analysing the networkx object and extract useful information from it, such 
        as convergence rate, neighbour matrix, its eigenvalues.
        
        ### Solver
        
        Used to find simple greedy solutions to a connected graph taken from graph theory. The current approaches are:
        
        - ``path``: Adds edges as a path from the start to end node
        - ``cycle``: Adds edges just like the path, but also one edge from the start to end node.
        - ``complete``: Adds edges between all nodes to all the other nodes, such as the maximum distance between every node is one.
        
        ### Visual
        
        Is used to print a networkx graph to the screen, with its edges.

        ## Usage
        
        ### Import
        
        
        ```python
        from extended_networkx_tools import Creator, Analytics, Visual, Solver
        ```
