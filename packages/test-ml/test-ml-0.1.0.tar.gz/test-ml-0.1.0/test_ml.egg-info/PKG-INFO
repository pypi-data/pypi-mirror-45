        Treat your machine learning models like any other software asset: properly test them and fail builds if they don't meet
        your desired performance.
        
        * Documentation: https://test-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (not live yet). For now, you can build the docs locally:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cd docs && make clean && make html
        
        Open then ``index.html`` in the newly created ``docs/_build`` folder and you're good to go.
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This library enables you to easily test machine learning artifacts. Specify a set of target metric,
        and the rest is taken care of.
        
        
        .. note:: Status: alpha. Active development, but breaking changes may come.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Rich CLI capabilities that enable you to configure metrics, input data, performance cut-offs, and more
        * Small, statically typed codebase, and extensive docstrings
        * Public API enabling embedding this library in any build process
        * Easily extensible with custom loaders, runners, and metrics
