Description: This package allows to work around
        weaknesses in the web application server Zope's security subsystem.
        Currently, it contains a single module ``proxy``.

        In principle, Zope makes a clear distinction between trusted code
        (which comes from the file system and cannot be modified through-the-web)
        and untrusted code (which might be tangled with through-the-web).
        Trusted code is unrestricted by Zope's security subsystem,
        untrusted code has permission checks on each object and method access.
        
        Unfortunately, occasionnally, trusted code performs its own
        security checks -- and can raise ``Unauthorized`` exceptions even
        when called from other trusted code. The ``proxy`` module
        is destined to work around this behaviour.
        It uses Zope's so called *proxy roles* to set up roles which
        should be used for internal security checks.
        
        The module defines the context manager ``proxy_roles(*roles)``,
        typically used as follows:
        
        >>> with proxy_roles(role1, role2, ...):
        >>>   ... perform any operation[s] with internal security checks ...
        
        This sets up proxy roles *role1, role2, ...* to be used
        for the internal security checks.
        
        Usually, the roles are ``'Manager', 'Authenticated'`` but can be anything.
        Note that proxy roles override any currently active user roles.
