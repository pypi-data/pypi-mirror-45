# Install applications using conda

Tiny conda extension (actually a commandline tool using conda) to install
applications.

The main advantages are:

- very simple **cross-platform** installation commands for Windows, macOS and
  Linux.

- the applications are installed in isolated conda environments.

- commands provided by the applications are available system-wide, i.e. when
  the associated conda environment is not activated.

## Installation of conda-app

```
conda activate base
pip install conda-app
```

-----------
**Warning**

Note that conda-app needs Python >= 3.6, so if your base environment still uses
Python 2.7, you first need to update it::

```
conda update conda
conda install python=3
```
-----------

## Example

With the conda-forge channel added (`conda config --add channels conda-forge`),
one should be able to install Mercurial (plus few important extensions) with:

```
conda-app install mercurial
```

**Open a new terminal** (on Windows, the "Conda Prompt") and the Mercurial 
command `hg` should be available.
