Description: # Access and Compliance
        
        Access and compliance is a simple Django app to check and verify a
        user's acceptance of University of Michigan's Access and Compliance
        policy.
        
        ## Quick start
        
        1. Add 'django_access_and_compliance' to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting like this:
        
        ```python
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                'django_access_and_compliance',
                ...
            ]
        ```
        
        2. Configure the following settings in your application:
        
        ```python
        # the URL for the desired access and compliance webservice
        ACCESS_AND_COMPLIANCE_VALIDATION_URL
        
        # truthy values returned by validation endpoint; e.g. true, yes, etc.
        ACCESS_AND_COMPLIANCE_TRUTHY_VALUES
        ```
        
        ## Behavior
        
        This application hooks into an existing Django application and listens for the login signal. Once a user logs in, it makes a request to the `ACCESS_AND_COMPLIANCE_VALIDATION_URL` and checks if the response body matches one of the truthy values specified in `ACCESS_AND_COMPLIANCE_TRUTHY_VALUES`.
        
        If the user has attested to the data access and compliance policy, they will be added to the 'Access and Compliance Members' group.
        
        It is up to the application admin to configure any applicable permissions on this group.
