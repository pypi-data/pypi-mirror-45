Copy of the BTrees structure definitions from "BTrees.BTreeModuleTemplate.c".

Unfortunately, the structure definitions are not packaged to be reuseable
externally. Therefore, we had to copy them.

Note, that it may become necessary to fetch a new copy, in case
the original definitions are changed in a significant way.


The header file has 'KEY_TYPE' as a free variable. It assumes
that the including context defines a 'KEY_TYPE' macro specifying
the type of keys in this btrees.

We are uninterested in values and define 'VALUE_TYPE' as void.
We also define "PERSISTENT" because we are only interested in
uses within the ZODB.
