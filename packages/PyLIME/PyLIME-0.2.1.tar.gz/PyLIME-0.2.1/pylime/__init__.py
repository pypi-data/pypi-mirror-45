"""The pylime module provides to users with three main objects:
* 'LimeFile': it is the simplest object in the PyLIME package, it
             provides access for reading or writing to a LIME file.
* 'LimeReader': 'buffered' reading of LIME files. 
* 'LimeWriter': 'buffered' writing of LIME files.
  
 The LimeReader/Writer objects are intended to be used when 
several LIME files must be processed sequentially, ie for computing 
something on a set of LIME files with the same structure.
