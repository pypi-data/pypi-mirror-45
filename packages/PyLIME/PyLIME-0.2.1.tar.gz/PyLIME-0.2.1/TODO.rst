To have a Minimum viable product
--------------------------------

* [ok] python2 -> python3
* [] tests, properly
* [ok] upload
* [] pythonize code
* [] docs
  

More
-----

* Add "pylime_*" utilities (like in c-lime)
* usage of 'messages'
* implement writer/reader
* document basic usage and installation
* clean design
* test it in some more real life computations (it has been tested in some
  LQCD computations with quark propagators, but other tests would be simpler, 
  like, also in LQCD, the computation of the plaquette)
