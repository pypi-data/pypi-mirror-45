# RepoLib

RepoLib is a Python library and CLI tool-set for managing your software 
system software repositories. It's currently set up to handle APT repositories
on Debian-based linux distributions. 

RepoLib is intended to operate on DEB822-format sources. It aims to provide
feature parity with software-properties for most commonly used functions.
