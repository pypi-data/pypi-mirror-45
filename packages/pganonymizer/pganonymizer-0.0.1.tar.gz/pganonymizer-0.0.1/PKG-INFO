        PGAnonymizer is a tool for anonymizing database for testing purposes.

        PGAnonymizer required Python 3.5 and above to run. PGAnonymizer can be installed using pip.

        ## Background
        PGAnonymizer will hash columns in table depending on the rules inside CSJ file.
        ### CSJ file format:
        ```
        "table", "column", "rule"
        "table_to_be_hased", "columned_to_be_hased", "rule_for_hashing"
        "table_to_be_hased", "columned_to_be_hased", "rule_for_hashing"
        "table_to_be_hased", "columned_to_be_hased", "rule_for_hashing"
        ```
        #### Example for rules for hashing
        `Hash` is for text type field such as name or address. The return value will be atmost 16 bytes
        Example input:
        ```
