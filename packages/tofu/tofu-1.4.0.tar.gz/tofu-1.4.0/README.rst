ToFu
====


ToFu stands for Tomography for Fusion, it is an open-source machine-independent python library
with non-open source plugins containing all machine-dependent routines.

It is distributed under the MIT license and aims at providing the fusion community with 
a transparent and modular tool for creating / designing diagnostics and using them for 
synthtic diagnostic (direct problem) and tomography (inverse problem).

It was first created at the Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Garching, Germany, 
by Didier Vezinet, and is now maintained / debugged / updated by him and other contributors.

A sphinx-generated documentation can be found at [the ToFu documentation page](https://ToFuProject.github.io/tofu/index.html),
and the code itself is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ToFuProject/tofu).


----

ToFu provides the user with a series of python classes for creating, handling and visualizing a diagnostic geometry, meshes and basis functions, 
geometry matrices, pre-treating experimental data and computing tomographic inversions.

Each one of these main tasks is accomplished by a dedicated module in the larger ToFu package.

In its current version, only the geometry and data-handling modules are released. 
The others, while operational, are not user-friendly and documented yet, they will be available in future releases.


The geometry module is sufficient for diagnostic designing and for a synthetic diagnostic approach (i.e.: computing the integrated signal from a simulated 2D or 3D emissivity).
This geometry module allows in particular:

* To handle linear and toroidal vaccum vessels
* To define apertures and detectors as planar polygons of arbitrary shapes, or to define a spherical converging lens and a circular detector in its focal plane.
* To assign an arbitrary number of apertures to each detector (and the apertures do not have to stand in parallel planes)
* To automatically compute the full Volume of Sight (VOS) in 3D of each {detector+aperture(s)} set
* To discretise the VOS for a numerical 3D integration of a simulated emissivity in order to compute the associated signal

It is in this geometrical sense that ToFu enables a synthetic diagnostic approach, it does not provide the tools for simulating the emissivity (that should be an input, provided by another code).

    cython
    nose
    pygments
    pandas
    polygon3 (or polygon2 if you are using python 2.7)

Checkout the ToFu git repository and from the top directory::
    
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    python setup.py install

**Warning**
This Pypi package focuses on tomography for fusion research.
It uses the same name as a previous package dedicated to a testing framework coupling fixtures and tests loosely, now renamed **reahl-tofu** and developped by Iwan Vosloo since 2006. If you ended up here looking for a web-oriented library, you should probably redirect to the more recent [**reahl-tofu**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reahl-tofu) page.
