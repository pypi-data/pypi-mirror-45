        Tiny Creeper is a CLI that automates putting linting and pre-commit hooks into your repo.  It currently supports:
        
        - [x] Python (black, 110 lines)
        - [ ] R (lintr, styler) (Need help here...)
        - [ ] Vue + JS + HTML + CSS (prettier, eslint)
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        To install and use:
        
        ```bash
        pip install tinycreeper
        cd your_repo_root
        tinycreeper init
        ```
        
        That's it.  To lint before pre-commit, run
        
        ```bash
        tinycreeper lint
        ```
        
        and for help run
        
        ```bash
        tinycreeper --help
        ```

        > Creepers are generally unobtrusive and are often indifferent to humans.  
        > Their bills are gently down-curved and rather long, used for probing bark for bugs.
