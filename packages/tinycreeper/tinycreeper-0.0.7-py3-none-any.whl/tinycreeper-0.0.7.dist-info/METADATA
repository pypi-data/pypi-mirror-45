Tiny Creeper is a CLI that automates putting linting and pre-commit hooks into your repo.  It currently supports:

- [x] Python (black, 110 lines)
- [ ] R (lintr, styler) (Need help here...)
- [ ] Vue + JS + HTML + CSS (prettier, eslint)

## Quickstart

To install and use:

```bash
pip install tinycreeper
cd your_repo_root
tinycreeper init
```

That's it.  To lint before pre-commit, run

```bash
tinycreeper lint
```

and for help run

```bash
tinycreeper --help
```

> Creepers are generally unobtrusive and are often indifferent to humans.  
> Their bills are gently down-curved and rather long, used for probing bark for bugs.
