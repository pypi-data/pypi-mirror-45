fleval
------

Simple light-weight flask app for grading homeworks, scoring
applications, reviewing papers, etc. A web-server runs locally and
starts a browser to allow you to step through documents, showing you a
two-pane view with the document on the left and a comment+score box on
the right, with easy insertion of lines from comments in other
documents (useful for commenting on common mistakes when grading
homeworks).
