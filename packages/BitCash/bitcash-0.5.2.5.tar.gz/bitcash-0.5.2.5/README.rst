BitCash: BitcoinCash made easy.
=======================

NOTE about cashaddresses
========================

Breaking change in 0.5.0!

Bitcoin Cash has changed address formats (from 1........ to bitcoincash:qsomething). We now support the new format. As of 0.5.0, the new address format is used internally and the .address returned from PrivateKey has changed to the new format. This is unfortunate to make such a change, but the work would have been far greater to have legacy addresses returned. PrivateKey.send() supports both legacy and cashaddresses.

If you have not done so already, *please pin your bitcash version*. Like, bitcash==0.5.0 in your setup.py. This way breaking changes won't break your application.

Some point after, legacy address support may be removed entirely. So please convert addresses to the new format before sending them on to BitCash: https://github.com/oskyk/cashaddress/

Forked from Ofek's awesome Bit library: https://github.com/ofek/bit

Despite what it looks like, this is mostly a working library for Bitcoin Cash! Try to ignore the out of date bits on the README which referred to Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash.

What needs fixing
----------------

- This README.
- Dynamic fees.
- The test cases...

**BitCash is so easy to use, in fact, you can do this:**

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bitcash import Key
    >>>
    >>> my_key = Key(...)
    >>> my_key.get_balance('usd')
    '12.51'
    >>>
    >>> # Let's donate!
    >>> outputs = [
    >>>     # Wikileaks
    >>>     ('1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v', 0.0035, 'bch'),
    >>>     # Internet Archive
    >>>     ('1Archive1n2C579dMsAu3iC6tWzuQJz8dN', 190, 'jpy'),
    >>>     # The Pirate Bay
    >>>     ('129TQVAroeehD9fZpzK51NdZGQT4TqifbG', 3, 'eur'),
    >>>     # xkcd
    >>>     ('14Tr4HaKkKuC1Lmpr2YMAuYVZRWqAdRTcr', 2.5, 'cad')
    >>> ]
    >>>
    >>> my_key.send(outputs)
    '9f59f5c6757ec46fdc7440acbeb3920e614c8d1d247ac174eb6781b832710c1c'

Here is the transaction `<https://blockchain.info/tx/9f59f5c6757ec46fdc7440acbeb3920e614c8d1d247ac174eb6781b832710c1c>`_.

Documentation
-------------

Docs are hosted by Github Pages and are automatically built and published
by Travis after every successful commit to BitCash's ``master`` branch.
