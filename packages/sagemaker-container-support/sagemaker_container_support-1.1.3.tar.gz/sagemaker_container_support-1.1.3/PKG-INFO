Description: ===========================
        SageMaker Container Support
        ===========================
        
        This package makes it easier to build docker images which run on Amazon SageMaker. For example, the official SageMaker `TensorFlow <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-containers>`_ and `MXNet <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-containers>`_ images use this package. The requirements for SageMaker-compatible images are documented here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms.html
        
        Features provided:
        
        - Integration with `SageMaker Python SDK  <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk>`_ Estimators, including:
        
          - Downloading user-provided python code
          - Deserializing hyperparameters (which preserves their python types)
        
        - ``bin/entry.py``, which acts as the docker entrypoint required by SageMaker
        - Reading in the metadata files provided to the container during training, as described here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo.html
        - nginx + Gunicorn HTTP server for serving inference requests which complies with the interface described here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html
