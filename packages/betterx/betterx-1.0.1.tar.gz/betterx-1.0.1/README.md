# BetterX

A better unix utility tool.

## About

BetterX aims to be a set of tools that would make your experience with the command line a lot smoother.

## Installation

Get it on your system using `pip` - 

```sh
$ pip install betterx
```

To get the bleeding edge version, install from git - 

```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/mentix02/betterx.git
```

## Documentation

Find the documentation here - [BetterX Docs](docs/README.md)

I almost never write exclusive documentation other than inline comments in my code (and that too only sparsely) but I took the initiative to do it for this project so do go through the docs. They're not perfect but it's a start.
