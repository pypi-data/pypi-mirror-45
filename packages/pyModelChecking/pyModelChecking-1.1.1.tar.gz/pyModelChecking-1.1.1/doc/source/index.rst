Welcome to `pyModelChecking`'s documentation!
=============================================

*pyModelChecking* is a simple Python model checking package.
Currently, it is
able to represent :ref:`Kripke structures<kripke_structure>`, :ref:`CTL<CTL>`,
:ref:`LTL<LTL>`, and :ref:`CTL*<CTLS>` formulas and it provides
`model checking`_ methods for LTL, CTL, and CTL*.
In future, it will hopefully support symbolic model checking.
