Description: # A note to our friends from the Humanist 2018 conference
        
        This is the package presented at the Humanist 2018 conference in the Hague, Netherlands. Note that it is always in active development. Whenever including it in your research, pull the latest version from this GitHub. Support is always available at: P.vanGent@tudelft.nl.
        
        **Thank you for your interest**
        
        # Installation
        ```
        python -m setup.py install
        ```
        
        Alternatively, we're also on PIP:
        ```
        python -m pip install heartpy
        ```
        
        That's it!

        # HeartPy - Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit
        
        [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1324311.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1324311)
        
        **HeartPy**, the **Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit** is a module for heart rate analysis in Python. It started as pure-python implementation to analyse physiological data taken in naturalistisch driving and cycling experiments.
        
        The module takes a discrete heart rate signal and outputs time-domain and frequency-domain measures often found in scientific literature:
        
        
        Time domain:
        * beats per minute, BPM
        * interbeat interval, IBI
        * standard deviation  if intervals between adjacent beats, SDNN
        * standard deviation of successive differences between adjacent R-R intervals, SDSD
        * root mean square of successive differences between adjacend R-R intervals, RMSSD
        * proportion of differences between R-R intervals greater than 20ms, 50ms, pNN20, pNN50
        * median absolute deviation, MAD
        
        Frequency domain
        * low frequency component (0.04-0.15Hz), LF
        * high frequency component (0.16-0.5Hz), HF
        * lf/hf ratio, Lf/HF

        ## To-do
        
        The module is still in active development. See the changelog for past changes. The to-do for the coming months is:
        
        to do before V1.2
        - [X] Validate performance on Physionet datasets
        - [ ] Update threshold parameter optimization to handle cases of double peaks and large portion of signal containing little to no hr
        - [ ] Report validation performance on repo (published paper + key-points document)
        - [X] Add R-position interpolation ('high accuracy' mode)
        - [X] Handle cases where strong T-peak in signal is present
        - [ ] Include example data on PIP release
        - [ ] Change peak fitting to optimize locally rather than globally, to handle long signals with noisy intermediate sections better
        - [X] Change segmented analysis method to run peak detection once on whole signal, then do segmentwise computation from working_data object (drastic speed up)
