        ``ukbparse`` is a Python library for pre-processing of UK BioBank data.
        
        
            ``ukbparse`` is developed at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative
            Neuroimaging (WIN@FMRIB), University of Oxford. ``ukbparse`` is in no way
            endorsed, sanctioned, or validated by the :ref:`UK BioBank
            <https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/>`_.
        
            ``ukbparse`` comes bundled with metadata about the variables present in UK
            BioBank data sets. This metadata can be obtained from the :ref:`UK BioBank
            online data showcase <https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/index.cgi>`_
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        
        Install ``ukbparse`` via pip::
        
        
            pip install ukbparse
        
        
        Or from ``conda-forge``::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge ukbparse
        
        
        Comprehensive documentation does not yet exist.
        
        
        Introductory notebook
        ---------------------
        
        
        The ``ukbparse_demo`` command will start a Jupyter Notebook which introduces
        the main features provided by ``ukbparse``. To run it, you need to install a
        few additional dependencies::
        
        
            pip install ukbparse[demo]
        
        
        You can then start the demo by running ``ukbparse_demo``.
        
        
        .. note:: The introductory notebook uses ``bash``, so is unlikely to work on
                  Windows.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        
        General usage is as follows::
        
        
            ukbparse [options] output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsv
        
        
        You can get information on all of the options by typing ``ukbparse --help``.
        
        
        Options can be specified on the command line, and/or stored in a configuration
        file. For example, the options in the following command line::
        
        
            ukbparse \
              --overwrite \
              --import_all \
              --log_file log.txt \
              --icd10_map_file icd_codes.tsv \
              --category 10 \
              --category 11 \
              output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsv
        
        
        Could be stored in a configuration file ``config.txt``::
        
        
            overwrite
            import_all
            log_file       log.txt
            icd10_map_file icd_codes.tsv
            category       10
            category       11
        
        
        And then executed as follows::
        
        
            ukbparse -cfg config.txt output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsv
        
        
        Customising
        -----------
        
        
        ``ukbparse`` contains a large number of built-in rules which have been
        specifically written to pre-process UK BioBank data variables. These rules are
        stored in the following files:
        
        
         * ``ukbparse/data/variables_*.tsv``: Cleaning rules for individual variables
         * ``ukbparse/data/datacodings_*.tsv``: Cleaning rules for data codings
         * ``ukbparse/data/types.tsv``: Cleaning rules for specific types
         * ``ukbparse/data/processing.tsv``: Processing steps
        
        
        You can customise or replace these files as you see fit. You can also pass
        your own versions of these files to ``ukbparse`` via the ``--variable_file``,
        ``--datacoding_file``, ``--type_file`` and ``--processing_file`` command-line
        options respectively.``ukbparse`` will load all variable and datacoding files,
        and merge them into a single table which contains the cleaning rules for each
        variable.
        
        Finally, you can use the ``--no_builtins`` option to bypass all of the
        built-in cleaning and processing rules.
        
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        
        To run the test suite, you need to install some additional dependencies::
        
        
              pip install ukbparse[test]
        
        
        Then you can run the test suite using ``pytest``::
        
            pytest
