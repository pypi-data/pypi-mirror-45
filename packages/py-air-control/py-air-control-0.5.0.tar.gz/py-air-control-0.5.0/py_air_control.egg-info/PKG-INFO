        Command line application for controlling Philips air purifiiers.
        
        It is tested with AC2729 and AC2889 models but it should work with all purifiers made by Philips.
        
        Installation
        ---
        Python 3.4+ is required. Install with `pip3`:
        ```
        $ pip3 install py-air-control
        ```
        
        Wi-Fi setup
        ---
        The purifier can be connected to a Wi-Fi network with the following steps:
        
         1. Put the purifier into pairing mode. On AC2729 this is done by holding the power and child-lock buttons for 3 seconds.
            The purifier will create an open "PHILIPS Setup" wi-fi network.
         2. Connect your PC to the "PHILIPS Setup" network and get IP settings via DHCP. The IP address of the purifier will be 192.168.1.1.
         3. Now you can re-configure the wi-fi network of the purifier like this:
        ```
        airctrl 192.168.1.1 --wifi-ssid <your_wifi_ssid> --wifi-pwd <your_wifi_password>
        ```
        
        Usage
        ---
        Getting the current status of device with IP 192.168.0.17:
        ```
        $ airctrl 192.168.0.17
        [pwr]   Power: ON
        [pm25]  PM25: 4
        [rh]    Humidity: 32
        [rhset] Target humidity: 60
        [iaql]  Allergen index: 1
        [temp]  Temperature: 22
        [func]  Function: Purification & Humidification
        [mode]  Mode: M
        [om]    Fan speed: 2
        [aqil]  Light brightness: 100
        [wl]    Water level: 100
        [cl]    Child lock: False
        ```
        You can change settings by using the prefix in the square brackets as a command line option.
        For example to set fan speed 2:
        
            $ airctrl 192.168.0.17 --om 2
        
        Set target humidity to 50%:
        
            $ airctrl 192.168.0.17 --rhset 50
        
        Change function to "Purification":
        
            $ airctrl 192.168.0.17 --func P
        
        Power off the device:
        
            $ airctrl 192.168.0.17 --pwr 0
        
        and so on
        
        To get filters status:
        ```
        $ airctrl 192.168.0.17 --filters
        Pre-filter and Wick: clean in 245 hours
        Wick filter: replace in 3965 hours
        Active carbon filter: replace in 1565 hours
        HEPA filter: replace in 3965 hours
        ```
