        ### Configuration
        
        Install using pip:
        
        ```[bash]
        pip install wagtail-quick-create
        ```
        
        After installing the module, add `wagtailquickcreate` to your installed apps in your settings file:
        
        ```[python]
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'wagtailquickcreate',
        ]
        ```
        
        Also add the models you would like to create quick links for to your settings file as `'your_app_name.YourModelName'`:
        
        EG:
        ```
        WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_PAGE_TYPES = ['news.NewsPage', 'events.EventPage']
        ```
        
        If you want the Quick Create links panel to _replace_ the wagtail summary panel, you can set this by adding the following to your settings
        
        ```
        WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_REPLACE_SUMMARY_PANEL = False
        ```
        
        If you would like to offer image and or document links, this can also be done by specifying the following in your settings:
        
        ```
        WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_DOCUMENTS = True
        WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_REPLACE_SUMMARY_PANEL = False
        ```
