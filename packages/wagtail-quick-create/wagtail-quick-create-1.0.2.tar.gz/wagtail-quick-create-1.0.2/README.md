### Configuration

Install using pip:

```[bash]
pip install wagtail-quick-create
```

After installing the module, add `wagtailquickcreate` to your installed apps in your settings file:

```[python]
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'wagtailquickcreate',
]
```

Also add the models you would like to create quick links for to your settings file as `'your_app_name.YourModelName'`:

EG:
```
WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_PAGE_TYPES = ['news.NewsPage', 'events.EventPage']
```

If you want the Quick Create links panel to _replace_ the wagtail summary panel, you can set this by adding the following to your settings

```
WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_REPLACE_SUMMARY_PANEL = False
```

If you would like to offer image and document links, this can also be done by specifying the following in your settings:

```
WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_DOCUMENTS = True
WAGTAIL_QUICK_CREATE_REPLACE_SUMMARY_PANEL = False
```
