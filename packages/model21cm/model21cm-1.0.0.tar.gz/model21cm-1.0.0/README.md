# PHYS 201: Data Analysis for Physicists
## Final Project: model21cm 

Authors: I. Davenport, N. DePorzio
Package Name: model21cm


This package infers the parameters for a model consisting of three parts: 

* The emission of 21cm light emitted from an excited state of interstallar hydrogen that has propagated according to cosmological models to an observer on Earth
* The affect of astrophysical foregrounds on the 21cm signal described above
* A noise term additional to the two affects above
