        Diary
        ~~~~~
        
        With :code:`diary` commands, you can use your wiki as a diary (surprise).
        
        The :code:`show` command will show you all your logs (today).
        
        The :code:`log` command will open up your :code:`$EDITOR` and after save+quit,
        it will append it for your diary page (today).
        
        When you call log, doku will check all the path back and generates
        content for the tree.
        
        For example:
        
        ::
        
           # Today is 2019-02-21 and your index is configured to be 'root'
           doku diary log
        
           # This will create the following pages if it's not exist
           :diary:2019:02:21
           :diary:2019:02:root
           :diary:2019:root
        
           # Will regenerate this page
           # if you log an entry in a year previously was not there
           :diary:root
        
           # from stdin (pipe)
           echo 'message' | doku diary log --pipe
        
           # decorate with <code>...</code>
           # automatically activated the --pipe flag
           ls -la | doku diary log --code
