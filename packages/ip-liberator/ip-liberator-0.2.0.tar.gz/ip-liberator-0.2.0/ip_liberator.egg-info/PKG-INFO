        Features
        --------
        
        * Update a list of security groups of your AWS account at once.
        * Grant access to informed ports for your current IP address or an informed IP.
        * Read profile files in JSON with all the information needed to contact.
        * Fit for use as script (e.g. to update your dynamic IP regularly).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install ip-liberator
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Consider a file ``/path/my-profile.json`` with the following content:
        
        .. code-block:: json
        
            {
              "credentials": {
                "access_key": "<AWS_ACCESS_KEY>",
                "secret_key": "<AWS_SECRET_KEY>",
                "region_name": "<AWS REGION>"
              },
              "config": {
                "operator": "John",
                "services": [
                  {
                    "name": "FTP+SFTP",
                    "port": "21-22"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "HTTPS",
                    "port": "443"
                  }
                ],
                "security_groups": [
                  "sg-<GROUP_ID_1>",
                  "sg-<GROUP_ID_2>"
                ]
              }
            }
        
        Using the profile defined above will create or update two entries in the informed security groups:
        
        - **John FTP+SFTP** granting access for the current IP the ports 21 and 22.
        - **John HTTPS** granting access for the current IP the port 443.
        
        To accomplish it, simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ ip-liberator --profile /path/my-profile.json
            Authorizing rules ['John FTP+SSH', 'John HTTPS'] to IP 192.30.253.112/32
            - sg-<GROUP_ID_1>
            - sg-<GROUP_ID_2>
