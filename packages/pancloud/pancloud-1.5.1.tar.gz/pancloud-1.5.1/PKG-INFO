Description: ===================================
        Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK
        ===================================
        
        Python idiomatic SDK for the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework.
        
        The Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK (or `pancloud` for short) was created to assist developers with
        programmatically interacting with the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework.
        
        The primary goal is to provide full, low-level API coverage for the following Application Framework services:
        
            - Logging Service
            - Directory Sync Service
            - Event Service
        
        The secondary goal is to provide coverage, in the form of helpers, for common tasks/operations.
        
            - Log/event pagination
            - OAuth 2.0 and token refreshing
            - More, coming soon!

        Features
        --------
        
        - HTTP client wrapper for the popular Requests library with full access to its features.
        - Language bindings for Logging Service, Event Service and Directory Sync Service.
        - Helper methods for performing common tasks, such as log/event pagination.
        - Support for OAuth 2.0 grant code authorization flow.
        - Library of example scripts illustrating how to leverage `pancloud`.
        - Support for API Explorer Developer Tokens (Introduced in v1.5.0).
        
        Status
        ------
        
        The Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK is considered **production/stable** at this time.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PyPI::
        
            $ pip install pancloud
        
        Install From GitHub
        -------------------
        
        Clone the repo::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pancloud.git
        
        Use |pipenv| to install all dependencies and create a virtualenv for your project::
        
            $ pipenv install
        
        You can specify which python version to use by adding "--two" or "--three"::
        
            $ pipenv --three install
        
        Activate the pipenv shell::
        
            $ pipenv shell
        
        Obtaining and Using OAuth 2.0 Tokens
        ------------------------------------
        
        Work with your Developer Relations representative to register your
        application and receive the credentials needed to obtain an `access_token`.
        Normally, this requires a `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `refresh_token`.
        API Explorer may optionally be used to generate a Developer Token, which can
        be used in place of the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `refresh_token`.

        * Updated Pipfile.lock.
        * Replaced recursion with loop pattern in `LoggingService` `xpoll()` method.
        * Added `decode('utf-8')` to base64 decoded JWT to ensure compatibility with `json.loads()`.
        * Addressed minor typos in docs.
        
        1.5.0 (2019-02-27)
        ------------------
        
        * Added `flush()` method to `EventService` class.
        * Added `auto_refresh` support to `HTTPClient` `_apply_credentials()` method.
        * Removed `auto_retry` feature from `HTTPClient` class.
        * Refactored `HTTPClient` class `request()` method keyword argument overrides.
        * Removed unused `token_revoke_url` keyword argument.
        * Added support for API Explorer Developer Tokens to `Credentials` class.
        * Refactored `Credentials` `refresh()` method.
        
        1.4.0 (2018-10-04)
        ------------------
        
        * Added default URL to `HTTPClient` class.
        * Updated docstrings for `StorageAdapter`, `TinyDBStore` and `Credentials` classes.
        * Now returning `state` as `str` instead of `UUID` in `get_authorization_url()` method.
        * Now unifying display results for -m/-s/--write. For -m you now need an output specifier (-j/-p) to print the response.
        * Added `decode_jwt_payload()` method to allow for extracting/using all JWT fields.
        * Added -s option to allow for invocation of setter methods. This allows modifying of credential store fields.
        * Added credential setters to allow for modifying credentials.
        * Updated examples.
        * Switched from using `requests` to `HTTPClient` in `Credentials` class.
        * Now checking JWT access_token `exp` to determine if refresh if needed.
        * Now generating a new `state` each time `get_authorization_url()` is called.
        * Added `__repr__` to `Credentials` class with support for masking secrets.
        * Updated -E --ack,nack,poll options usage to be accurate.
        * `JOB_FAILED` response in `xpoll()` queryStatus now includes errorCode.
        
        1.3.0 (2018-08-04)
        ------------------
        
        * Added support for custom read/write credentials path.
        * `TinyDBStore` `fetch_credential()` now returns `None` instead of empty `str`.
        * Fixed bug that caused `_resolve_credential()` to be executed an inefficient number of times.
        * Now updating `HTTPClient` headers instead of overriding them which previously broke HTTP persistence.
        * Added JMESPath `isotime()` function to `summit.py` which prints epoch.
        * Added argument to `EventService` `xpoll()` method to support sleeping between polls.
        * Added `PAN_` prefix to envars to avoid name collisions.
        * Fixed bug when `R['R1_obj']['LoggingService.query']` is None and allow json=None case with special case of --end -1 which will not set a default end of now.
        * Fixed bug that nulled out credentials if an error occurred during a `fetch_tokens()` or `refresh()` operation.
        * Now enforcing strict credential resolution. Previous behavior allowed for merging credentials from different providers.
        * Added support for caching `refresh_token` to support rolling.
        * Added support for writing logs to `summit.py`.
        * Switch from using `data` param to `json` param in client/service methods.
        * Now defaulting `R1` to `None` so don't send body unless specified.
        * Now printing request headers and body at debug level 3 in `summit.py`.
        * Added enhancements to `summit.py` for specifying `startTime` and `endTime`.
        
        1.2.3 (2018-06-21)
        ------------------
        
        * Reversed the `access_token` lookup order in get_credentials() method.
        * Added `_resolve_credential()` to `access_token()` property method to support token caching.
        * Now comparing passed `access_token` in `refresh()` method to value returned by property method.
        
        1.2.2 (2018-06-20)
