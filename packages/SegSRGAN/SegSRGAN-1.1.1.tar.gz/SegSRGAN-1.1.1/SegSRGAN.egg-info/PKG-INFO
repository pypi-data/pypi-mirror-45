Description: # SegSRGAN
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install SegSRGAN`
        
        ## Perform a segmentation
        
        `from SegSRGAN.SegSRGAN.Function_for_application_test_python3 import segmentation`
        
        `segmentation(input_file_path, step, NewResolution, path_output_cortex, path_output_HR, weights_path, patch=None,
                         spline_order=3, by_batch=False, is_conditional=False)`
                         
        Where:
        > * **input_file_path** is the path of the image to be super resolved and segmented 
        > * **step** is the shifting step for the patches
        > * **NewResolution** is the new z-resolution we want for the output image 
        > * **path_output_cortex** output path of the segmented cortex
        > * **path_output_HR** output path of the super resolution output image
        > * **weights_path** is the path of the file which contains the pre-trained weights for the neural network
        > * **patch** is the size of the patches
        > * **spline_order** for the interpolation
        > * **by_batch** is to enable the by-batch processing
        > * **is_conditional** to perform a conditional GAN on the LR image resolution
