Description: # Radio Emission from Stellar Winds
        
        This is a Python code to calculate the radio emission produced by the winds around stars. 
        The code calculates thermal bremsstrahlung that is emitted from the wind, which depends directly on the density and temperature of the stellar wind plasma. 
        The program takes input data in the form of an interpolated 3d grid of points (of the stellar wind) containing position, temperature and density data. 
        From this it calculates the thermal free-free emission expected from the wind at a range of user-defined frequencies. 
        
        This code is used in a publication currently submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 
        
        
        ## Installation
        The code is available using pip:
        `pip install radiowinds`
        
        Or alternatively can be cloned directly from this repository:
