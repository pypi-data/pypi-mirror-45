Django Music Publisher is open source software for original music publishers.
It is a tool for **managing metadata** on musical works and recordings,
including data on writers, recording and performing artists, albums and music
libraries, as well as **royalty distribution processing**.

It uses **Common Works Registration (CWR)** protocol for batch registration of
musical works.
