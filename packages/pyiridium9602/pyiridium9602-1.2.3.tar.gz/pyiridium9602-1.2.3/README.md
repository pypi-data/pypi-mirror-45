# pyiridium9602 
Python 3 iridium satelite communication library for the iridium 9602 modem.

## Purpose
I wrote this library after trying to work with pyRockBlock foud at https://github.com/MakerSnake/pyRockBlock. The pyRockblock library 
was a great resource to start with, but I quickly found out it did not suit the needs for my application. I had too many problems 
with the serial port readline commands and long timeouts hanging my GUI application. I ended up digging through the documentation 
about the iridium 9602 modem at http://www.nalresearch.com/Info/AT%20Commands%20for%20Models%209602.pdf and wrote this library. 
This library is strictly a callback based library, although blocking methods are provided as well.

See the modules under the tests folder for examples of how to use the library.

## Example
Try running `python -m pyiridium9602.pyiridium_server COM1` and `python -m pyiridium9602.pyiridium COM1` to see how the library works.

```
# ===== Command Line: pyiridium_server.py COM2 =====
Enter a message to send: Hello World!
Enter a message to send: Hi
Enter a message to send: 

# ===== Command Line: pyiridium.py COM2 =====
Warning No threads are listening for responses. A thread will be created 
Signal Quality (0 - 5): 5
System Time: 3521898596
Serial Number: 60134
Message acquired: b'Hello'
Message acquired: b'Hi'

# ===== pyiridium_server.py COM2 =====
Enter a message to send: exit

# ===== Command Line: pyiridium.py COM2 =====
Message acquired: b'exit'

# Both programs close
```

Use the Signal class (or create your own class) and use custom callback methods while the IridiumCommunicator class manages all of the communications.

```python
import pyiridium9602

# Create your own serial port object and give it as the first argument or just give it the port name.
iridium_port = pyiridium9602.IridiumCommunicator("COM2")

# Message parser
def parse_data(data):
    print("My data:", data)

def message_failed(msg_len, content, checksum, calc_check):
    print("Message Failed checksum or length!", msg_len, content, checksum, calc_check)

# Use the default signal class and override the Signal API methods or create your own object.
iridium_port.signal.connected = lambda: print("Connected!")
iridium_port.signal.disconnected = lambda: print("Disconnected!")
iridium_port.signal.serial_number_updated = lambda s: print("Serial Number:", s)
iridium_port.signal.system_time_updated = lambda s: print("System Time:", s)
iridium_port.signal.signal_quality_updated = lambda sig: print("Signal Quality (0-5):", sig)
iridium_port.signal.check_ring_updated = lambda tri, sri: print("Telephone Indicator:", tri, 
                                                                "\nSBD Indicator:", sri)
iridium_port.signal.message_received = parse_data
iridium_port.signal.message_receive_failed = message_failed
iridium_port.signal.notification = print

# NOTE: There is no thread in this example, so `connect()` creates a thread to Complete the connection process
iridium_port.connect() # Raises IridiumError if the port cannot be opened or if the ping did not find a response.

# Non blocking command requests
iridium_port.request_signal_quality()
iridium_port.queue_system_time()

# If you run a request immediately after a request then the response will error
# This is because the first command will have it's value returned while the new request is the expected command
#iridium_port.request_serial_number()

# Blocking command (wait for previous command and wait to complete)
with iridium_port.wait_for_command():
    iridium_port.request_signal_quality()

# Blocking command (wait for previous command and wait to complete)
with iridium_port.wait_for_command():
    iridium_port.check_ring()  # If an SBD ring is found automatically start the session to read the value.

# Blocking Command (Do not wait for previous `wait_for_previous=0`)
serial_number = iridium_port.acquire_response(pyiridium9602.Command.SERIAL_NUMBER, wait_for_previous=0)
print("Manual Serial Number:", serial_number)

# Pre-made Blocking Command
sig = iridium_port.acquire_signal_quality()
print("Manual Signal Quality (0 - 5):", sig)

# Stop the `iridium_port.listen_thread` and close the port
iridium_port.close()

```

## Threading
The IridiumCommunicator was created to work with threading that is why the Signal callback class exists.

To use threading follow the example below.

```python
import pyiridium9602
import threading
import time

# Create your own serial port object and give it as the first argument or just give it the port name.
iridium_port = pyiridium9602.IridiumCommunicator("COM2")

class CustomSignal(object):
    """Create a cusotm Signal callback manager.
    
    Note:
        If other Signal methods do not exist they will be created as empty methods. If the notification method
        does not exist it will use the print function. You may want to use the notification method for logging special events.
