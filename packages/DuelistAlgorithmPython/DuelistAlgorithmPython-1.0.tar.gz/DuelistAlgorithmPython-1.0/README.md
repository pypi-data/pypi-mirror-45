I would like to clarify that various figures of this README.md document is taken from the original artical as shown above.


# Theory (From Biyanto et al., 2015)
Duelist Algorithm is a metaheuristic for mathematical optimization problems. Metaheuristic are a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity. Examples for metaheuristics include genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, etc. Many of these metaheuristics rely on population-based search, which utilizes many "searchers" (also refered to as "particles" or "swarms") to simultaneously search the solution space.

The procedure of Duelist Algorithm is shown in the figure below (see Fig 1). Quoting from the authors:
>The Duelist Algorithm starts with an initial set of duelists. The duel is to determine the winner and loser. The loser learns from the winner, while the winner try their new skill or technique that may improve their fighting capabilities. A few duelists with highest fighting capabilities are called as champion. The champion train a new duelists such as their capabilities. The new duelist will join the tournament as a representative of each champion. All duelist are re-evaluated, and the duelists with worst fighting capabilities is eliminated to maintain the amount of duelists.

In the Duelist Algorithm, the best solutions in a population are chosen as the champions, while worst solutions are eliminated (see Fig 2). Winner mutates themselves and attempts to improve, while losers learns from winner (has a chance to copy traits of winner).

In the original paper, Duelist Algorithm was shown to out-perform a few state-of-art metaheuristic algorithm for some specific tasks (see Fig 3). Therefore, it is very interesting.

# Short Tutorial

**There are four simple steps to run an optimization problem using Duelist Algorithm**

(Example 2 from example folder)

** Prerequisites **

```python
from solver.Duelist_Algorithm import DuelistAlgorithm
```

** 1. Define your function. Say you want to minimize the equation f=(x1,x2) = (x1)^2+(x2)^2 **

```python
def f(x1,x2):
	return x1*x1+x2*x2
```

** 2. Define the variables that can be *manipulated* for optimization. Define their names as string and put them in an array. **

```python
x=["x1","x2"]
```

** 3. Define the boundaries for the manipulated variables:**

 Say:

 x1 is bounded from -2 to 10 (-2 is min value of x1 and 10 is max value of x1)

 x2 is bounded from 10 to 15 (10 is min value of x2 and 15 is max value of x2)

 We can arrange these boundaries according to the definition array in step 2.

```python
 xmin=[-2,5]
 xmax=[10,15]
```

** 4. Setup the solver and start the solve procedure. **

```python
DA=DuelistAlgorithm(f,x,xmin,xmax,max_gen=1000)
DA.solve(plot=True)
```

***RESULTS***

From the console we can deduce the optimal result (see Fig. 4) . The global optimal has a fitness of 25, while duelist algorithm found 25.01. Error of 0.01 can be reduced by putting more maximum generations in solver.

![result1](images/results.PNG)

*Fig 4. Optimal Results in Console*

We can see that the algorithm quickly converges to the optimal point (see Fig. 5) as reported by the original article. Note that graph is decreasing instead of increasing (in the case of original paper) because our objective is to MINIMIZE instead of maximizing. You can just add a negative sign in the function to get maximization.
