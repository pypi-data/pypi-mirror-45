Description: sphinx-graphml
        ==============
        
        A GraphML charts embedding extension for Sphinx_.
        
        This extensions simply uses the GraphMLViewer_ tool provided by yWorks_. Admittedly, it is based
        on Flash and will no longer be supported from the end of 2020, but this is still the easiest and
        best option to display a ``.graphml`` chart created with yEd_ in a browser. Hopefully by the end
        of 2020 there will be adequate svg-based solutions.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        As simple as it can be with ``pip``::
        
           pip install sphinx-graphml
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add the extension name to your ``conf.py``::
        
           extensions = [
              ...
              'sphinx_graphml',
              ...
           ]
        
        
        In your documentation::
        
           .. graphml:: rel/path/to/my_graph.graphml
              :height: 500px
        
        (the default height is 300px)
        
        
        Issues
        ------
        
        If you load your documentation from a file (and not from a web server) using a flash player
        version higher than 23, you won't see the charts. See
        `this article <http://kb.yworks.com/article/676/>`_ and
        `this other one <https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2209269>`_ for workarounds.
