==============
Run unit tests
==============

This is a guide for developers who want to run unit tests in their local
machine.

Prerequisite
============

Install OS-specific prerequisites::

    # Ubuntu/Debian (recommend Ubuntu 16.04):
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libmysqlclient-dev build-essential python-dev \
                            python3.5-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev \
                            python-gdbm

Install pip::

    curl -s https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python

Install common prerequisites::

    sudo pip install virtualenv flake8 tox testrepository git-review os-testr

You may need to explicitly upgrade virtualenv if you've installed the one
from your OS distribution and it is too old (tox will complain). You can
upgrade it individually, if you need to::

    sudo pip install -U virtualenv

Zun source code should be pulled directly from git::

    # from your home or source directory
    cd ~
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/zun
    cd zun


Running the tests
=================

All unit tests should be run using tox. To run Zun's entire test suite::

    # run all tests (unit and pep8)
    tox

To run a specific test, use a positional argument for the unit tests::

    # run a specific test for Python 2.7
    tox -epy27 -- test_container

You may pass options to the test programs using positional arguments::

    # run all the Python 2.7 unit tests (in parallel!)
    tox -epy27 -- --parallel

To run only the pep8/flake8 syntax and style checks::

    tox -epep8
