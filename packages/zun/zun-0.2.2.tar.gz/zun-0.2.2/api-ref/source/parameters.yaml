  type: string
nets:
  description: |
    A list of networks for the container. When you do not specify the nets
    parameter, the container attaches to the only network created for the
    current tenant. To provision the container with a NIC for a network,
    specify the UUID or name of the network in the ``network`` attribute.
    To provision the container with a NIC for an already existing port,
    specify the port id or name in the ``port`` attribute.

    If multiple networks are defined, the order in which they appear in the
    container will not necessarily reflect the order in which they are given
    in the request. Users should therefore not depend on device order
    to deduce any information about their network devices.

    The special values *auto* and can be specified for networks. *auto* tells
    the Containers service to use a network that is available to the project,
    if one exists. If one does not exist, the Containers service will attempt
    to automatically allocate a network for the project (if possible). *none*
    tells the Containers service to not allocate a network for the instance.
    The *auto* and *none* values cannot be used with any other network values,
    including other network uuids, ports, fixed IPs or device tags. These are
    requested as strings for the networks value, not in a list.
