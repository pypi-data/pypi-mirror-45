Description: # aioiotprov
        
        A library/utility to provision IoT devices
        
        This is early day.  Currently it can provision TP-Link smartplugs, Broadlink IR blasters,  Sonoff switches running
        the Tasmota firmware, Shelly devices and E-Trix power monitors
        
        This uses nmcli or wpa_cli to control and configure WIFI access. This means this will work only with
        Linux, and then again not all. It is working on a RaspberryPi running Debian Stretch (No NetworkManager) and works on a laptop ruunning Ubuntu 18.10
        
        When using nmcli, it is possible to use a connected WiFi adapter, this has not yet been tested with wpa_cli
        
        I hope to add soon: Lifx, Tuya
        
        # Installation
        
        We are on PyPi so
        
            pip3 install aioiotprov
        
        
        # Running
        
        You can just run it by doing
        
            python3 -m aioiotprov "My SSID" "My Secret Key"
        
        If you want to set user, password and for sonoff, MQTT, do something like
        
            python3 -m aioiotprov -u user -p password "My SSID" "My Secret Key" \
            -o "sonoff:mqtt=on,user=mqttuser,password=mqttpass,host=somehost,port=1883,client=DVES_XXXXXX,topic=sonoff-XXXXXX,full topic=blabla/%prefix%/%topic%/"
        
        For Shellies,
        
            python3 -m aioiotprov -u user -p password "My SSID" "My Secret Key" \
            -o "shelly:mqtt=on,user=mqttuser,password=mqttpass,host=somehost,port=1883"
        
        Setting option will only works with plugins that can handle those.
        
        # How it works
        
        Mostly each plugin knows what SSID to llok for. If one of the needed SSID is found, aioiotprov will connect
        to the SSID and hand over provisioning duties to the plugin.
