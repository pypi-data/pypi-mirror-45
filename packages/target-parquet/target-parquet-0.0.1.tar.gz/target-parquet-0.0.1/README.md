# target-parquet

A [Singer](https://singer.io) target that writes data to parquet files. This target is based on [`target-csv`] [Targetcsv] and the code was adapted to generate parquet files instead of csv files.

## How to use it

`target-parquet` works with a [Singer Tap] in order to move data ingested by the tap into parquet files. 
Note that the parquet file will be written once all the data is imported from the tap.

### Install 

We will use [`tap-exchangeratesapi`][Exchangeratesapi] to pull currency exchange rate data from a public data set as an example.

First, make sure Python 3 is installed on your system or follow these installation instructions for [Mac] or [Ubuntu].

It is recommended to install each Tap and Target in a separate Python virtual environment to avoid conflicting dependencies between any Taps and Targets.

```bash
 # Install tap-exchangeratesapi in its own virtualenv
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/tap-exchangeratesapi
source ~/.virtualenvs/tap-exchangeratesapi/bin/activate
pip3 install tap-exchangeratesapi
deactivate

# Install target-parquet in its own virtualenv
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/target-parquet
source ~/.virtualenvs/target-parquet/bin/activate
pip3 install target-parquet
deactivate
```

### Run

We can now run `tap-exchangeratesapi` and pipe the output to `target-parquet`.

```bash
~/.virtualenvs/tap-exchangeratesapi/bin/tap-exchangeratesapi | ~/.virtualenvs/target-parquet/bin/target-parquet
```

By default, the data will be written into a file called `exchange_rate-{timestamp}.parquet` in your working directory.

```bash
â€º cat exchange_rate-{timestamp}.parquet
AUD,BGN,BRL,CAD,CHF,CNY,CZK,DKK,GBP,HKD,HRK,HUF,IDR,ILS,INR,JPY,KRW,MXN,MYR,NOK,NZD,PHP,PLN,RON,RUB,SEK,SGD,THB,TRY,ZAR,EUR,USD,date

```

### Optional Configuration

If you want to save the file in a specific location and not the working directory, then, you need to create a configuration file, in which you specify the path to the directory you are interested in and pass the `-c` argument to the target. 
Also, you can compress the parquet file by passing the `compression_method` argument in the configuration file. Note that, at the moment (April, 2019), the only compression mode available in `pyarrow` is `gzip`.  Thus, this is the only value that will ensure that the parquet file will be compressed. Anything else (bz2, zip, xz), will generate an exception in the `pyarrow` module.
For an example of the configuration file, see [config.sample.json](config.sample.json).

To run `target-parquet` with the configuration file, use this command:

```bash
~/.virtualenvs/tap-exchangeratesapi/bin/tap-exchangeratesapi | ~/.virtualenvs/target-parquet/bin/target-parquet -c config.json
```
