# Radar-Boxplot

This package provides the implementation of the radar-boxplot, a charting technique create and developed by the author (Caio Hamamura).

It merges the concepts of both radar chart and the boxplot chart, allowing to compare multivariate data for multiple classes/clusters at a time. It provides a intuitive understanding over the data by creating radar polygons which can be compared in terms of shape and thickness, giving a meaningful insight towards identifying high inner variation and similar classes/clusters.

By interpreting the radar-boxplot, it is possible to predict classification confusion over classes and understand why and what could be done to achieve a better result.
