Overview
--------

This is the source distribution of Versile Python for python
v2.6 and v2.7. The latest source code is available from
https://github.com/versiledev/versile-python .

Versile Python comes in two distributions, one distribution for python
2.6+ and a second distribution for python 3.x. The two distributions share a
common codebase and the 3.x distribution is generated from the 2.x codebase
with the python '2to3' migration tool.

The latest stable release can also be downloaded from
http://www.sci4all.org/versile/ or installed from the python package index,
either "pip install versile-python2" (python v2.6+) or
"pip install versile-python3" (python v3.x).


Installation
------------

This package comes with a distutils installation script. To install
execute the following command in a shell:

    "python setup.py install"

Note the command may have to be executed with administrative
privileges (e.g. sudo or a root shell) and depending on setup a full
path to the executable may need to be provided. Also ensure the python
executable is compatible with python versions v2.6 and v2.7.

It is strongly recommended to also download and install PyCrypto
(https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/) if available on the
platform. When present it will significantly speed up cryptographic
methods and enable additional ciphers such as AES.

For testing or user-specific installations consider using virtualenv,
see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
