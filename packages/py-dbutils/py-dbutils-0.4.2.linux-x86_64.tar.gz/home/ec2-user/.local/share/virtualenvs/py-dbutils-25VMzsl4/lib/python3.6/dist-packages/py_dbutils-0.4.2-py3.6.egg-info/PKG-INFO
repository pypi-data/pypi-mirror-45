        Description
        ===========
        
        
        Forget about boiler plate code to setup and tear database connections:
        This library will give you all the basic methods to pull and push data from various types of database
        Initial release will support Postgres and Mysql.
        I will focus on python 3.7 just to discourage people from continuing the python 2.7 train.
        Move to 3.6+ and get learn something new.
