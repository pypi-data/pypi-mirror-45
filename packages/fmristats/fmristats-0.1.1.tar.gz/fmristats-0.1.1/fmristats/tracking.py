    Tracking a rigid body

    This will track a rigid body, which has been sampled at a fixed
    lattice in :math:`ℝ^3`, by the so-called principle axis method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray, shape (n,x,y,z)
        Matrix of observations
    reference : Affine
        Affine transformation that maps an index to (physical) position

    Returns
    -------
    scan_inverse_references : Affines
        Rigid body transformations that map from the given coordinate
        system (specified by the affine `reference`) to the coordinate
        system of the body, in which zero corresponds to the bary centre
        of the body and the base axis correspond to its principle axis.

        Note that this is the other way around: In the terminology of
        the MB estimator, this corresponds to :math:`ρ_t^{-1}`.
    w : ndarray, shape (n,3)
        Principle semi axis lengths of the rigid body.

    Notes
    -----
    The function implements a (or the) principle axis method for rigid
    body tracking.  The method fits a orthonormal base (i.e. a
    coordinate system) onto data, such that the base vectors correspond
    to the principle axis (v) of the body.  The returned scan_inverse_references
    are affine transformations that map from the specified coordinate
    system to the coordinates of these points in the body.
