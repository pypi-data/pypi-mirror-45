    Creates a time vector from parameters

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple, type: int
    epi_code : int or None
    temporal_resolution : float
        The temporal resolution.
    interleaved : bool

    Returns
    -------
    slice_time : ndarray of float, shape (M,) or (M,N,O,P)
        The time vector that holds the slices time information. The
        vector holds the start point of the time at which a particular
        slice has been measured.  If ep is None, slice_time has
        shape (M,) with M equal to the number of full scan cycles.  If
        ep is int, then slice_time has
        the same shape as the data.
