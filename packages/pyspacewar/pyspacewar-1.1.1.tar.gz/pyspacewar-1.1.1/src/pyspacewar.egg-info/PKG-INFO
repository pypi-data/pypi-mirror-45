Description: Two ships duel in a gravity field.   Gravity doesn't affect
        the ships themselves (which have spanking new anti-gravity
        devices), but it affects missiles launced by the ships.
        
        You can play against the computer, or two players can play
        with one keyboard.  There is also a Gravity Wars mode, where
        the two ships do not move, and the players repeatedly
        specify the direction and velocity of their missiles.
