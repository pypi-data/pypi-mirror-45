A clever CSV parser.

The goal of this package is to provide a drop-in replacement for the Python 
CSV library that uses the dialect detection method developed in the paper 
[Wrangling Messy CSV Files by Detecting Row and Type 
Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11242).

**NOTE** this repository is under heavy development and should be considered 
pre-alpha software. If you're interested in this package, please "star" the 
repository on GitHub.
