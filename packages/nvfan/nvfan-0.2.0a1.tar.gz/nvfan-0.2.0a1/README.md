nvfan
======

A module to control Nvidia Graphic Cards' fan in your python script.

## Why?

My deep learning rig contains 2 GTX 1080ti graphic cards with no liquid cooling. It takes only a few minutes for the GPUs to hit the thermal threshold of 86Â°C after I start a training process. Yet, it only uses fans at 50% rate.

There is an option to control fan speed manually using Nvidia Preferences GUI. But it annoys me run a desktop to control fans!

There are scripts around that use `nvidia-settings` to control fan right in the command line. Actually, I used them a lot and I am not satisfied. So I built mine.

## What is special about it?

It integrates with my python scripts. The immediate benefit is that it gives control back to the driver after the work is finished. So I don't hear the noise more than necessary!

It can be used as a standalone script with enough options to control GPUs indiviually.

# How to use it?

Controlling nvidia gpu fan requires an `X` server to be running. To run `X` without having a monitor attached to the system requires special config.


## Preparation

Setup x config in a shell like below. You may need to use `sudo`.

```
$ nvidia-xconfig --enable-all-gpus --cool-bits=7 --connected-monitor=Monitor0 --allow-empty-initial-configuration --force-generate
```

*Warning: we used `--force-generate` flag. A backup of your previous config is saved and is reported as the result of running this function.*

## Run X

I think the best way is to use xinit:

```
$ xinit &
```

## Install nvfan

```
$ pip install nvfan
```

## Usage

You can use command line script:

```
$ nvfan constant -g 0 -s 60
```

Or in your python script:

```python
import nvfan

first_gpu = 0
nvfan.constant(first_gpu, 60)
```

The above script, puts GPU 0 in `constant` mode with 60% speed. You can use `aggressive` or `driver` modes too:

```python
second_gpu = 1

# In aggressive mode, a small increase in temperature causes a large increase in fan speed.
nvfan.aggressive(second_gpu)

# Give control back to the driver manually. Please note that after execution is finished, this line is automatically called so you don't have to.
nvfan.driver(first_gpu)
nvfan.driver(second_gpu)
```

Instead of using the module you can use the `GPU` class to have more control (i.e. setting custom X11 display, if not set `DISPLAY` environment variable is used, or if not set, `:0` is used as fallback)

```python
import gpufan

gpu = gpufan.GPU(0, display=":1")  # or use default `None` for automatic lookup of display
gpu.aggressive()
```

## Caution

Use this module at your own risk. The author takes no responsibility and the scripts come with no warranty.
