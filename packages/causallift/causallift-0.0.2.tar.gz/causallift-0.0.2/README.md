If you are simply building a Machine Learning model and executing promotion campaigns to the customers who are predicted to, for example, buy a product, it is not efficient.

There are customers who will buy a product anyway even without promotion campaigns (called "Sure things").
It is even possible that there are customers who will buy a product only if not targeted (called "Do Not Disturbs" or "Sleeping Dogs").

The solution is called Uplift Modeling.

### What is Uplift Modeling?


Uplift Modeling is a Machine Learning technique to find which individuals should be "treated" (or targeted) and which individuals should not. 

Applications of Uplift Modeling for business include:
- Increase revenue by finding which customers should be targeted for advertising/marketing campaigns and which customers should not. 
- Retain revenue by finding which customers should be contacted to prevent churn and which customers should not. 

Resources to understand the concepts of Uplift Modeling include:

### What's special about CausalLift from perspective of Causal Inference?

CausalLift is a basic application of Causal Inference with focus on decision making based on CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect) or ITE (Individual Treatment Effect).

### What's special about CausalLift from perspective of Uplift Modeling?

CausalLift is a basic application of Uplifting Modeling that works with observational datasets not from A/B Testing and outputs intuitive metrics for evaluation.

### Why CausalLift was developed?

In a word, to use for real-world business.

- Existing packages for Uplift Modeling assumes the dataset is from A/B Testing (a.k.a. Randomized Controlled Trial). In real-world business, however, observational datasets in which treatment (campaign) targets were not chosen randomly are more common especially in the early stage of evidence-based decision making. CausalLift supports observational datasets using a basic methodology in Causal Inference called "Inverse Probability Weighting" based on assumption that propensity to be treated can be inferred from the available features.

- There are 2 challenges of Uplift Modeling; explainability of the model and evaluation. CausalLift utilizes a basic methodology of Uplift Modeling called Two Models approach (training 2 models independently for treated and untreated samples to compute the CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effects) or uplift scores) to address these challenges.

	- [Explainability of the model] Since it is relatively simple, it is less challenging to explain how it works to stakeholders in business.

	- [Explainability of evaluation] To evaluate Uplift Modeling, metrics such as Qini and AUUC (Area Under the Uplift Curve) are used in research, but these metrics are difficult to explain to the stakeholders. For business, a metric that can estimate how much more profit can be earned is more practical. Since CausalLift adopted the Two-Model approach, the 2 models can be reused to simulate the outcome of following the recommendation by the Uplift Model and can estimate how much conversion rate (the proportion of people who took desired action such as buying a product) will increase using the uplift model.

### What kind of data can be fed to CausalLift?
Table data including the following columns:

- Features 
	- a.k.a independent variables, explanatory variables, covariates
	- e.g. customer gender, age range, etc.
	- Note: Categorical variables need to be one-hot coded so propensity can be estimated using logistic regression. [pandas.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) can be used.
- Outcome: binary (0 or 1)
	- a.k.a dependent variable, target variable, label
	- e.g. whether the customer bought a product, clicked a link, etc.
- Treatment: binary (0 or 1)
	- a variable you can control and want to optimize for each individual (customer) 
	- a.k.a intervention
	- e.g. whether an advertising campaign was executed, whether a discount was offered, etc.
	- Note: if you cannot find a treatment column, you may need to ask stakeholders to get the data, which might take hours to years.
- [Optional] Propensity: continuous between 0 and 1
	- propensity (or probability) to be treated 
	- If not provided, CausalLift can estimate from the features using logistic regression. Not needed for A/B Testing data.

### To-dos

- Improve documentation (using Sphinx)
- Add examples of applying uplift modeling to more publicly available datasets (such as [Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data) as [pymatch](https://github.com/benmiroglio/pymatch) did.
- Clarify the model summary output including visualization
- Support for classification models other than XGBoost (Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.) to predict outcome
- Support for classification models other than Logistic Regression to estimate propensity scores which would need calibration
- Support for multiple treatments
