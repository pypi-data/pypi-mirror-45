Geomancer is a geospatial feature engineering library. It leverages geospatial
data such as [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) alongside a
data warehouse like BigQuery. You can use this to create, share, and iterate
geospatial features for your downstream tasks (analysis, modelling,
visualization, etc.). 

## Features

Geomancer can perform geospatial feature engineering for all types of vector data
(i.e. points, lines, polygons).

- Feature primitives for geospatial feature engineering
- Ability to switch out data warehouses (BigQuery, SQLite, PostgreSQL (*In Progress*))
- Compile and share your features using our SpellBook 

## Setup and Installation

### Installing the library

Geomancer can be installed using `pip`.

```
$ pip install geomancer
```

This will install **all** dependencies for every data-warehouse we support. If
you wish to do this only for a specific warehouse, then you can add an
identifier:

```
$ pip install geomancer[bq] # For BigQuery
$ pip install geomancer[sqlite] # For SQLite
$ pip install geomancer[psql] # For PostgreSQL
```

Alternatively, you can also clone the repository then run `install`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer.git
$ cd geomancer
$ python setup.py install
```

### Setting up your data warehouse

Geomancer is powered by a geospatial data warehouse: we highly-recommend using
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) as your data warehouse and
[Geofabrik's OSM catalog](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) as your
source of Points and Lines of interest.

You can see the set-up instructions in [this link](https://geomancer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#setting-up-your-data-warehouse)

## Basic Usage

All of the feature engineering functions in Geomancer are called "spells". For
example, you want to get the distance to the nearest supermarket for each
point.

```python
from geomancer.spells import DistanceToNearest

# Load your dataset in a pandas dataframe
# df = load_dataset()

dist_spell = DistanceToNearest(
    "supermarket",
    source_table="ph_osm.gis_osm_pois_free_1",
    feature_name="dist_supermarket",
    dburl="bigquery://project-name",
).cast(df)
```

You can specify the type of filter  using the format `{column}:{filter}`.  By
default, the `column` value is `fclass`. For example, if you wish to look for
roads on a bridge, then pass `bridge:T`:

```python
from geomancer.spells import DistanceToNearest

# Load the dataset in a pandas dataframe
# df = load_dataset()

dist_spell = DistanceToNearest(
    "bridge:T",
    source_table="ph_osm.gis_osm_roads_free_1",
    feature_name="dist_road_bridges",
    dburl="bigquery://project-name",
).cast(df)
```

Compose multiple spells into a "spell book" which you can export as a JSON file.

```python
from geomancer.spells import DistanceToNearest
from geomancer.spellbook import SpellBook

spellbook = SpellBook([
    DistanceToNearest(
        "supermarket",
        source_table="ph_osm.gis_osm_pois_free_1",
        feature_name="dist_supermarket",
        dburl="bigquery://project-name",
    ),
    DistanceToNearest(
        "embassy",
        source_table="ph_osm.gis_osm_pois_free_1",
        feature_name="dist_embassy",
        dburl="bigquery://project-name",
    ),
])
spellbook.to_json("dist_supermarket_and_embassy.json")
```

You can share the generated file so other people can re-use your feature extractions
with their own datasets.

```python
from geomancer.spellbook import SpellBook

# Load the dataset in a pandas dataframe
# df = load_dataset()

spellbook = SpellBook.read_json("dist_supermarket_and_embassy.json")
dist_supermarket_and_embassy = spellbook.cast(df)
```
