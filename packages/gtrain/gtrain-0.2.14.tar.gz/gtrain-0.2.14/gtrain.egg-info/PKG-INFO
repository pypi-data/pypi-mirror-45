Description: #gtrain
        
        Project that using abstraction of the model and data to define structures that can be used for learning. Model can bee learned by gtrain function to fit the data properly.
        This abstraction allows to implement almost everything you want without need to implementing learning algorithm all the time.
        For example it can easily handle various input length witch is not common in other implementations.
        
        ##Model
        
        Abstaction for model in *TensorFlow*. 
        Implements functionality like 
        * todo
        
        ##Data
        
        Abstraction of the data for feeding the model within the training algorithm.
        Implements functionality like 
        * todo
