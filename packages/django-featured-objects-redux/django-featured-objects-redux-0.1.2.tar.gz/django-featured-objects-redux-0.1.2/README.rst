Installation
============

First install the module, preferably in a virtual environment. It can be installed from PyPI:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install django-featured-objects-redux

Setup
=====

You'll need to add ``featured`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's ``settings.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += [
        'featured',
    ]

Then run ``./manage.py migrate`` to create the required database tables.

Configuration
=============

There is only one mandatory configuration option you need to set in your ``settings.py`` :

.. code-block:: python

    FEATURABLE_MODELS = (
        ('app_label', 'model_name'), 
        ('app_label', 'another_model_name'),
    )

Please see the ``example`` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good example.

You need Django 1.8 or above to run that. It might run on older versions but that is not tested.

Usage
=====
[TBD]
