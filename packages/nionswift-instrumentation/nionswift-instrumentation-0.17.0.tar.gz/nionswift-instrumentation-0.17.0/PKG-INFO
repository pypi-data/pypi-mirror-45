        MultiAcquire
        ------------
        
        A plug-in for Nion SwiftÂ¹ that acquires and displays multiple EEL spectra with different energy offsets.
        
        Usage
        +++++
        
        Main window
        +++++++++++
        Get the plug-in main window by selecting it from the "Window" menu.

        ### Summary
        This plugin allows you to acquire EEL spectra with multiple energy offsets and exposure settings. The acquisitions can
        be set up with the table in the main window. Every spectrum corresponds to one line. Use the "+" and "-" buttons to add or remove
        lines. The first column shows the spectrum number, which will also be added to the titles of the result data items.
        Note that the progress bar will only update once per spectrum (i.e. if only one spectrum is defined it will jump
        straight from 0 to 100%).
        
        
        Settings Window
        +++++++++++++++
        You can access the settings menu via the "Settings..." button in the top-right corner of the main window.

        ### Summary
        In order to set the energy offsets, the plugin needs to know which control it has to change in AS2. Type the name of
        this control into the "X-shift control name" field. If the field is empty, x-shifts are disabled, regardless of what
        is configured in the main window.
        The checkboxes in the bottom row allow you to configure how the data will be returned:
        
        * "Bin data in y-direction" will sum the images in vertical direction to obtain spectra.
        * "Auto dark subtraction" will blank the beam after the acquisition is finished and repeat it (with the exact same settings). This data will be then be used as dark images for the actual data. Make sure "Blanker control name" is set correctly, otherwise this mode will fail.
        * "Sum frames" will sum all frames that were acquired for each spectrum (as specified by the column "frames" in the main window). If this is off, the plug-in will return a stack for each spectrum.
        
        
        Output
        ++++++
        The plug-in will create one result data item per spectrum. These data items can be either single spectra, single images,
        stacks of spectra or stacks of images, depending on the settings. Additionaly the plug-in will create a data item that
        contains all acquired spectra as multiple line plots. This last data item will only be created if "Bin data in y-direction"
        is selected in the settings window.
