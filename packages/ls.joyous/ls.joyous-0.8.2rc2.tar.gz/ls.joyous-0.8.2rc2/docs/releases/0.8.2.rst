What's new
==========

Wagtail 2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Support for Wagtail 2.5 (and Django 2.2).

Postponement Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Show cancellation details for postponement page in /from/ sub-view.

Other features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Include version number in calendar table tag.
 * Add django admin interface.
 * Restructured templates to use more inheritance and less inclusion.
 * Refactor ByDayIterables using EventsByDayList.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
 * |version| macro isn't working with ReadTheDocs, so hardcoded it.
 * Fix display of Cancellations

Upgrade considerations
======================

ThisEvent
~~~~~~~~~
The namedtuple ThisEvent now has this definition

    .. code-block:: python

        ThisEvent = namedtuple("ThisEvent", "title page url")

The extra field, ``url``, is used to customise the url for an event.  This is
used to link to the /from/ sub-vew of Postponement Pages.

When unpacking the tuple you will have to include this field too, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        {% for title, page, url in evod.days_events %}
