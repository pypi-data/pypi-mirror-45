            reuse is a tool for compliance with the `REUSE

        Background
        ----------
        
        Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software
        from different projects that are released under various different
        licenses. The `REUSE Initiative <https://reuse.software/>`__ was started
        by the `FSFE <https://fsfe.org>`__ to provide a set of recommendations
        to make licensing your free software projects easier. Not only do these
        recommendations make it easier for you to declare the licenses under
        which your works are released, but they also make it easier for a
        computer to understand how your project is licensed.
        
        As a short summary, the recommendations are threefold:
        
        1. Provide the exact text of each license used, verbatim.
        
        2. Include a copyright notice and license in (or about) each file.
        
        3. Provide an inventory for included software.
        
        You are recommended to read the
        `recommendations <https://reuse.software/practices/>`__ in full for more
        details.
        
        This tool exists to facilitate the developer in complying to the above
        recommendations. It will serve as a linter for compliance, and as a
        compiler for generating the bill of materials.
        
        There are other tools, such as
        `FOSSology <https://www.fossology.org/>`__, that have a lot more
        features and functionality surrounding the analysis and inspection of
        copyright and licenses in software projects. reuse, on the other hand,
        is solely designed to be a simple tool to assist in compliance with the
        REUSE Initiative recommendations.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        To install reuse, you need to have the following pieces of software on
        your computer:
        
        -  Python 3.5+
        
        -  Pip
        
        -  ``python3-pygit2``
        
        You can install ``python3-pygit2`` via your operating system’s package
        manager. For Debian-like GNU/Linux distributions this would be::
        
            apt-get install python3-pygit2
        
        Note that simply installing ``pygit2`` via ``pip`` does not work as this
        omits the ``libgit2`` dependency.
        
        You can also use reuse without ``python3-pygit2`` at the cost of
        significantly degraded performance as the amount of files to process
        increases.
        
        To install reuse, you only need to run the following command::
        
            pip3 install --user fsfe-reuse
        
        After this, make sure that ``~/.local/bin`` is in your ``$PATH``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, read the `REUSE
        recommendations <https://reuse.software/practices/>`__. In a nutshell:
        
        -  Include the texts of all used licenses in your project.
        
           -  A special note on the GPL: If you use
              ``Valid-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0`` or name the file
              ``LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt``, this will catch all the following
              licenses: ``GPL-3.0``, ``GPL-3.0+``, ``GPL-3.0-only`` and
              ``GPL-3.0-or-later``. This applies to the entire GPL family of
              licenses.
        
        -  Add a comment header to each file that says
           ``SPDX-License-Identifier:
           GPL-3.0-or-later``. Replace
           ``GPL-3.0-or-later`` with the license that applies to the file. If
           you cannot edit the comment header, include a
           `debian/copyright <https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/>`__
           file.
        
        -  Add a comment header to each file that says ``© YEAR  NAME``. You can
           be flexible with the format, just make sure that the line starts with
           the copyright sign: ``©``. You can add multiple lines.
        
        Once you have taken those steps (again, read the actual recommendations
        for better instructions), you can use this tool to verify whether your
        project is fully compliant with the REUSE recommendations. To check
        against the recommendations, use ``reuse lint``::
        
            ~/Projects/curl$ reuse lint
            .gitattributes
            README
            docs/libcurl/CMakeLists.txt
            lib/.gitattributes
            [...]
        
        All the listed files have no licence information associated with them.
        
        To generate a bill of materials, use ``reuse compile``::
        
            ~/Projects/curll$ reuse compile

        Ideally, you would distribute this bill of materials together with the
        tarfile distribution of your project.
        
        Make sure that, when outputting to a file, this file ends in the
        ``.spdx`` extension. If you do not do this, the tool will attempt to
        include the file itself into the bill of materials, which obviously will
        not work.

        Starting local development is very simple, just execute the following
        commands::
        
            git clone git@gitlab.com:reuse/reuse.git
            cd reuse/
            python3 -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            make develop
        
        You need to run ``make develop`` at least once to set up the virtualenv.
        
        Next, run ``make help`` to see the available interactions.
