fixes:
  - Adds ``[swift]/endpoint_override`` option to explicitly set the endpoint
    URL used for Swift. Ironic uses the Swift connection URL as a base for
    generation of some TempURLs. Added parameter enables operators to fix
    the problem when image is attached (via TempURL) as vmedia (e.g. in iLO
    driver) and BMC doesn't have connectivity to public network.
    By default this parameter is not set for backward compatibility.
