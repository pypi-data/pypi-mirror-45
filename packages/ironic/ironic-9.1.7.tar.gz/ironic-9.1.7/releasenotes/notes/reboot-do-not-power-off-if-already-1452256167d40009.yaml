    Fixes a problem when using ipmitool and rebooting a node which would cause
    a deploy to fail. Now when rebooting a node we check if the node is already
    powered off, if it is we don't attempt to power off the node. This is
    because some BMCs will error if the node is already powered off and an
    ipmitool request is made to power it off. See
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1718794 for details.
