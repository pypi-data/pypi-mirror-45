Description: # GangliPy
        
        GangliPy is a collection of neural networks evaluated to be the best for certain types of tasks.
        
        # In Progress
        
        
        ## Auto OCR
        
        The first project here is an attempt to recognize all 60,000 unicode characters using a single hidden layer.
        
        Fully connected input and output layers have proven sufficient for recognizing 16x16 unicode images, and can even 
        predict never before seen characters.

        However, 'predicting never before seen characters' fades to noise when enough characters are seen, so another layer is 
         needed to make this 'variational' and keep realistic guesses when failing to perfectly predict.
        
        ## Unicode Regognition Tests
        
        The unicode recognition tests I'm using for Auto OCR will need to be pulled out and placed into a seperate testing and 
        evaluation repository.
        
        # Installation
        
        There is currently no pip repository available. Once Auto OCR is finished, it will be pulled out into its own repo and 
        will be added as a requirement to this one.
