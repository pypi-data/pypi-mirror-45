Overview
--------

An OptimizationControlMechanism is a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that uses an `OptimizationFunction` to find
an optimal `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` for a given `state
<OptimizationControlMechanism_State>`. The `OptimizationFunction` uses the OptimizationControlMechanism's
`evaluation_function` <OptimizationControlMechanism.evalutate_function>` to evaluate `control_allocation
<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` samples, and then implements the one that yields the best predicted result.
The result returned by the `evaluation_function` <OptimizationControlMechanism.evalutate_function>` is ordinally
the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` computed by the OptimizationControlMechanism for the `Composition`
(or part of one) that it controls, and its `ObjectiveFunction` seeks to maximize this, which corresponds to
maximizing the Expected Value of Control, as described below.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC:

**Expected Value of Control**

The `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` of an OptmizationControlMechanism, like any `ControlMechanism`
is computed as the difference between the `outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` computed by its `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` and the `costs <ControlMechanism.costs>` of its `control_signals
<ControlMechanism.control_signals>` for a given `state <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>` (i.e.,
set of `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` and `control_allocation
<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.  If the `outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` is configured to measure the
value of processing (e.g., reward received, time taken to respond, or a combination of these, etc.),
and the `OptimizationFunction` assigned as the OptimizationControlMechanism's `function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` is configured find the `control_allocation
<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that maximizes its `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`,
then the OptimizationControlMechanism is said to be maximizing the `Expected Value of Control (EVC)
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23889930>`_.  That is, it implements a cost-benefit analysis that
weighs the `costs <ControlMechanism.costs>` of the ControlSignal `values <ControlSignal.value>` specified by a
`control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` against the `outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` expected
to result from it.  The costs are computed based on the `cost_options <ControlSignal.cost_options>` specified for
each of the OptimizationControlMechanism's `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>` and its
`combine_costs <ControlMechanism.combine_costs>` function.  The EVC is determined by its `compute_net_outcome
<ControlMechanism.compute_net_outcome>` function (assigned to its `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`
attribute), which is computed for a given `state <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>` by the
OptimizationControlMechanism's `evaluation_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.evalutation_function>`.

COMMENT:
The table `below <OptimizationControlMechanism_Examples>` lists different
parameterizations of OptimizationControlMechanism that implement various models of EVC Optimization.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Representation_Types:

**Agent Representation and Types of Optimization**

The defining characteristic of an OptimizationControlMechanism is its `agent representation
<OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Rep>`, that is used to determine the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>
for a given `state <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>` and find the `control_allocation
<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that optimizes this.  The `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>`
can be either the `Composition` to which the OptimizationControlMechanism belongs (and controls) or another one that
is used to estimate the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for that Composition.  This distinction
corresponds closely to the distinction between *model-based* and *model-free* optimization in the `machine learning
<HTML REF>`_ and `cognitive neuroscience <https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1560>`_ literatures, as described below.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Free_Model_Based:

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Free:

*Model-Free Optimization*

This is achieved by assigning as the `agent_rep  <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` a Composition other than the
one to which the OptimizationControlMechanism belongs (and for which it is the `controller <Composition.controller>`).
In each `trial`, the `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` is given the chance to adapt, by adjusting its
parameters in order to improve its prediction of the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for the Composition
(or part of one) that is controlled by the OptimizationControlMechanism (based on the `state
<OptimizationControlMechanism_State>` and `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` of
the prior trial).  The `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` is then used to predict the `net_outcome
<ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` samples to find the one
that yields the best predicted `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` of processing on the upcoming trial,
based on the current or (expected) `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` for that trial.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Based:

*Model-Based Optimization*

This is achieved by assigning as the `agent_rep  <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` the Composition to which
the OptimizationControlMechanism belongs (and for which it is the `controller <Composition.controller>`). On each
`trial`, that Composition itself is used to simulate processing on the upcoming trial, based on the current or
(expected) `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` for that trial, in order to find the
<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that yields the best net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for that trial.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Creation:

Creating an OptimizationControlMechanism
----------------------------------------

An OptimizationControlMechanism is created in the same was as any `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`.
The following arguments of its constructor are specific to the OptimizationControlMechanism:

* **features** -- takes the place of the standard **input_states** argument in the constructor for a
  Mechanism`, and specifies the values used by the OptimizationControlMechanism, together with a `control_allocation
  <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`, to calculate a `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`.  Features can be
  specified using any of the following, singly or combined in a list:

  * *InputState specification* -- this can be any form of `InputState specification <InputState_Specification>`
    that resolves to an OutputState from which the InputState receives a Projection;  the `value
    <OutputState.value>` of that OutputState is used as the feature. Each of these InputStates is marked as
    `internal_only <InputStates.internal_only>` = `True`.

  Features can also be added to an existing OptimizationControlMechanism using its `add_features` method.  If the
  **features** argument is not specified, then the `input <Composition.input_values>` to the `Composition` on the last
  trial of its execution is used to predict the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for the upcoming trial.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Feature_Function:

* **feature_function** -- specifies `function <InputState>` of the InputState created for each item listed in
  **features**.  By default, this is the identity function, that assigns the current value of the feature
  to the OptimizationControlMechanism's `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` attribute.
  However, other functions can be assigned, for example to maintain a record of past values, or integrate them over
  trials.
..
* **agent_rep** -- specifies the `Composition` used by the OptimizationControlMechanism's `evaluation_function
  <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>` to calculate the predicted `net_outcome
  <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a given `state <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>` (see `below
  <OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Rep>` for additional details). If it is not specified, the
  `Composition` to which the OptimizationControlMechanism belongs is assigned, and the OptimizationControlMechanism
  is assigned as that Composition's `controller <Composition.controller>`, implementing `model-based
  <OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Based>` optimization.  If that Composition already has a `controller
  <Composition.controller>` specified, the OptimizationControlMechanism is disable. If another Composition is
  specified, it must conform to the specifications for an `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` as
  described `below <OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Rep>`.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

In addition to the standard Components associated with a `ControlMechanism`, including a `Projection <Projection>`
to its *OUTCOME* InputState from its `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`, and a
`function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` used to carry out the optimization process, it has several
other constiuents, as described below.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism:

*ObjectiveMechanism*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like any `ControlMechanism`, an OptimizationControlMechanism has an associated `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` that is used to evaluate the outcome of processing for a given trial and pass
the result to the OptimizationControlMechanism, which it places in its `outcome <OptimizationControlMechanism.outcome>`
attribute.  This is used by its `compute_net_outcome <ControlMechanism.compute_net_outcome>` function, together with
the `costs <ControlMechanism.costs>` of its `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`, to compute the
`net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` of processing for a given `state <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>`,
and that is returned by `evaluation` method of the OptimizationControlMechanism's `agent_rep
<OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>`.

.. note::
    The `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` is distinct from, and should not be
    confused with the `objective_function <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>` parameter of the
    OptimizationControlMechanism's `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  The `objective_mechanism
    <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` evaluates the `outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` of processing
    without taking into account the `costs <ControlMechanism.costs>` of the OptimizationControlMechanism's
    `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`.  In contrast, its `evaluation_function
    <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>`, which is assigned as the
    `objective_function` parameter of its `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, takes the `costs
    <ControlMechanism.costs>` of the OptimizationControlMechanism's `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`
    into account when calculating the `net_outcome` that it returns as its result.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Features:

*Features*
^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to its `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` (which receives a projection from the *OUTCOME*
OutpuState of the `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`,
an OptimizationControlMechanism also has an `InputState` for each of its features. By default, these are the current
`input <Composition.input_values>` for the Composition to which the OptimizationControlMechanism belongs.  However,
different values can be specified, as can a `feature_function <OptimizationControlMechanism_Feature_Function>` that
transforms these.  For OptimizationControlMechanisms that implement `model-free
<OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Free>` optimization, its `feature_values
<OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` are used by its `evaluation_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>` to predict the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a
given `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.  For OptimizationControlMechanisms that implement
`model-based <OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Based>` optimization, the `feature_values
<OptimizationCozntrolMechanism.feature_values>` are used as the Composition's `input <Composition.input_values>` when
it is executed to evaluate the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a given
`control_allocation<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.

Features can be of two types:

* *Input Features* -- these are values received as input by other Mechanisms in the `Composition`. They are
  specified as `shadowed inputs <InputState_Shadow_Inputs>` in the **features** argument of the
  OptimizationControlMechanism's constructor (see `OptimizationControlMechanism_Creation`).  An InputState is
  created on the OptimziationControlMechanism for each feature, that receives a `Projection` paralleling
  the input to be shadowed.
..
* *Output Features* -- these are the `value <OutputState.value>` of an `OutputState` of some other `Mechanism` in
  the Composition.  These too are specified in the **features** argument of the OptimizationControlMechanism's
  constructor (see `OptimizationControlMechanism_Creation`), and each is assigned a `Projection` from the specified
  OutputState(s) to the InputState of the OptimizationControlMechanism for that feature.

The current `value <InputState.value>` of the InputStates for the features are listed in the `feature_values
<OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` attribute.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_State:

*State*
^^^^^^^

The state of the Composition (or part of one) controlled by an OptimizationControlMechanism is defined by a combination
of `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` (see `above <OptimizationControlMechanism_Features>`)
and a `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Rep:

*Agent Representation*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The defining feature of an OptimizationControlMechanism is its agent representation, specified in the **agent_rep**
argument of its constructor and assigned to its `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` attribute.
This designates a representation of the `Composition` (or parts of one) that the OptimizationControlMechanism controls,
that is used to evaluate sample `control_allocations <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` in order to find the one
that optimizes the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`. The `agent_rep
<OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` is always itself a `Composition`, that can be either the same one that the
OptimizationControlMechanism controls or another one that is used to estimate the `net_outcome
<ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for that Composition (see `above
<OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Representation_Types>`).  The `evaluate <Composition.evaluate>` method of the
Composition is assigned as the `evaluation_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>` of the
OptimizationControlMechanism.  If the `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` is not the Composition
for which the OptimizationControlMechanism is the controller, then it must meet the following requirements:

    * Its `evaluate <Composition.evaluate>` method must accept as its first three arguments, in order,
      values that correspond in shape to  the `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>`,
      `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` and `num_estimates
      <OptimizationControlMechanism.num_estimates>` attributes of the OptimizationControlMechanism, respectively.
    ..
    * If it has an `adapt <Composition.adapt>` method, that must accept as its first three arguments, in order,
      values that corresopnd to the shape of the `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>`,
      `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` and `net_outcome
      <OptimizationControlMechanism.net_outcome>` attributes of the OptimizationControlMechanism. respectively.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Function:

*Function*
^^^^^^^^^^

The `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` of an OptimizationControlMechanism is used to find the
`control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that optimizes the `net_outcome
<ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for the current (or expected) `features <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>`.
It is generally an `OptimizationFunction`, which in turn has `objective_function
<OptimizationFunction.objective_function>`, `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>`
and `search_termination_function <OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` methods, as well as a `search_space
<OptimizationFunction.search_space>` attribute.  The OptimizationControlMechanism's `evaluation_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>` is automatically assigned as the
OptimizationFunction's `objective_function <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>`, and is used to
evaluate each `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` sampled from the `search_space
<OptimizationFunction.search_space>` by the `search_function `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>`
until the `search_termination_function <OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` returns `True`.
A custom function can be assigned as the `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` of an
OptimizationControlMechanism, however it must meet the following requirements:

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Custom_Funtion:

  - It must accept as its first argument and return as its result an array with the same shape as the
    OptimizationControlMechanism's `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.
  ..
  - It must implement a `reinitialize` method that accepts **objective_function** as a keyword argument and
    implements an attribute with the same name.

    COMMENT:
    - it must implement a `reinitialize` method that accepts as keyword arguments **objective_function**,
      **search_function**, **search_termination_function**, and **search_space**, and implement attributes
      with corresponding names.
    COMMENT

If **function** argument is not specified, the `GridSearch` `OptimiziationFunction` is assigned as the default,
which evaluates the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` using the OptimizationControlMechanism's
`control_allocation_search_space <OptimizationControlMechanism.control_allocation_search_spaces>` as its
`search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>`, and returns the `control_allocation
<ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that yields the greatest `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`,
thus implementing a computation of `EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>`.

COMMENT:
.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Search_Functions:

*Search Function, Search Space and Search Termination Function*

Subclasses of OptimizationControlMechanism may implement their own `search_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.search_function>` and `search_termination_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.search_termination_function>` methods, as well as a
`control_allocation_search_space <OptimizationControlMechanism.control_allocation_search_space>` attribute, that are
passed as parameters to the `OptimizationFunction` when it is constructed.  These can be specified in the
constructor for an `OptimizationFunction` assigned as the **function** argument in the
OptimizationControlMechanism's constructor, as long as they are compatible with the requirements of
the OptimizationFunction and OptimizationControlMechanism.  If they are not specified, then defaults specified
either by the OptimizationControlMechanism or the OptimizationFunction are used.
COMMENT

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

When an OptimizationControlMechanism is executed, it carries out the following steps:

  * Calls `adapt` method of its `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` to give that a chance to
    modify its parameters in order to better predict the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a given `state
    <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>`, based the state and `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` of the
    previous trial.
  ..
  * Calls `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` to find the `control_allocation
    <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that optimizes `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`.  The
    way in which it searches for the best `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` is determined by
    the type of `OptimzationFunction` assigned to `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, whereas the way
    that it evaluates each one is determined by the OptimizationControlMechanism's `evaluation_function
    <OptimizationControlMechanism.evalutation_function>`.  More specifically:

    * The `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` selects a sample `control_allocation
      <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` (using its `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>`
      to select one from its `search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>`), and evaluates the predicted
      `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for that `control_allocation
      <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` using the OptimizationControlMechanism's `evaluation_function`
      <OptimizationControlMechanism.evalutation_function>` and the current `feature_values
      <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>`.
    ..
    * It continues to evaluate the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for `control_allocation
      <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` samples until its `search_termination_function
      <OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` returns `True`.
    ..
    * Finally, it implements the `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` that yielded the optimal
      `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`.  This is used by the OptimizationControlMechanism's `control_signals
      <ControlMechanism.control_signals>` to compute their `values <ControlSignal.value>` which, in turn, are used by
      their `ControlProjections <ControlProjection>` to modulate the parameters they control when the Composition is
      next executed.

    performance of the `Composition` to which it belongs

    Arguments
    ---------

    objective_mechanism : ObjectiveMechanism or List[OutputState specification]
        specifies either an `ObjectiveMechanism` to use for the OptimizationControlMechanism, or a list of the
        `OutputState <OutputState>`\\s it should monitor; if a list of `OutputState specifications
        <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States>` is used, a default ObjectiveMechanism is created and the list
        is passed to its **monitored_output_states** argument.

    features : Mechanism, OutputState, Projection, dict, or list containing any of these
        specifies Components, the values of which are assigned to `feature_values
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` and used to predict `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>`.
        Any `InputState specification <InputState_Specification>` can be used that resolves to an `OutputState` that
        projects to the InputState.

    feature_function : Function or function : default None
        specifies the `function <InputState.function>` for the `InputState` assigned to each `feature
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_Features>`.

    agent_rep : Composition  : default Composition to which the OptimizationControlMechanism belongs
        specifies the `Composition` used by the `evalution_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>`
        to predictd the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a given `state
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>`.  If a Composition other than the default is assigned,
        it must be suitably configured (see `above <OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Rep>` for additional details).
        If the default is used, the OptimizationControlMechanism is assigned as the Composition's `controller
        <Composition.controller>` unless one has already been assigned, in which case the
        OptimizationControlMechanismit is disabled.

    search_function : function or method
        specifies the function assigned to `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` as its
        `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>` parameter, unless that is specified in a
        constructor for `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  It must take as its arguments
        an array with the same shape as `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` and an integer
        (indicating the iteration of the `optimization process <OptimizationFunction_Process>`), and return
        an array with the same shape as `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.

    search_termination_function : function or method
        specifies the function assigned to `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` as its
        `search_termination_function <OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` parameter, unless that is
        specified in a constructor for `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  It must take as its
        arguments an array with the same shape as `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` and two
        integers (the first representing the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for the current
        `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`, and the second the current iteration of the
        `optimization process <OptimizationFunction_Process>`);  it must return `True` or `False`.

    search_space : list or ndarray
        specifies the `search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>` parameter for `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, unless that is specified in a constructor for `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  Each item must have the same shape as `control_allocation
        <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`.
    function : OptimizationFunction, function or method
        specifies the function used to optimize the `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`;
        must take as its sole argument an array with the same shape as `control_allocation
        <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`, and return a similar array (see `Function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_Function>` for additional details).

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for the
        OptimizationControlMechanism, its `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, and/or a custom function
        and its parameters.  Values specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those
        parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default see `name <OptimizationControlMechanism.name>`
        specifies the name of the OptimizationControlMechanism.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default Mechanism.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the OptimizationControlMechanism; see `prefs
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.prefs>` for details.

    Attributes
    ----------

    feature_values : 2d array
        the current value of each of the OptimizationControlMechanism's `features
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_Features>` (each of which is a 1d array).

    agent_rep : Composition
        determines the `Composition` used by the `evalution_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>`
        to predict the `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a given `state
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>` (see `above <OptimizationControlMechanism_Agent_Rep>`for additional
        details).

    function : OptimizationFunction, function or method
        takes current `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` (as initializer),
        uses its `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>` to select samples of `control_allocation
        <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` from its `search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>`,
        evaluates these using its `evaluation_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>`, and returns
        the one that yields the optimal `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` (see `Function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_Function>` for additional details).

    evaluation_function : function or method
        returns `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` for a given `state <OptimizationControlMechanism_State>`
        (i.e., combination of `feature_values <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>` and `control_allocation
        <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`. It is assigned as the `objective_function
        <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>` parameter of `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, and calls the `evaluate` method of the OptimizationControlMechanism's
        `agent_rep <OptimizationControlMechanism.agent_rep>` with a `control_allocation
        <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>`, the OptimizationControlMechanism's `num_estimates
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.num_estimates>` attribute, and the current `feature_values
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.feature_values>`.

    COMMENT:
    search_function : function or method
        `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>` assigned to `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`; used to select samples of `control_allocation
        <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` to evaluate by `evaluation_function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>`.

    search_termination_function : function or method
        `search_termination_function <OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` assigned to
        `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`;  determines when to terminate the
        `optimization process <OptimizationFunction_Process>`.
    COMMENT

    control_allocation_search_space : list of SampleIterators
        `search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>` assigned by default to `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, that determines the samples of
        `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` evaluated by the `evaluation_function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.evaluation_function>`.  This is a proprety that, unless overridden,
        returns a list of the `SampleIterators <SampleIterator>` generated from the `allocation_sample
        <ControlSignal.allocation_sample>` specifications for each of the OptimizationControlMechanism's
        `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`.

    saved_samples : list
        contains all values of `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` sampled by `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` if its `save_samples <OptimizationFunction.save_samples>` parameter
        is `True`;  otherwise list is empty.

    saved_values : list
        contains values of `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` associated with all samples of
        `control_allocation <ControlMechanism.control_allocation>` evaluated by by `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` if its `save_values <OptimizationFunction.save_samples>` parameter
        is `True`;  otherwise list is empty.

    name : str
        name of the OptimizationControlMechanism; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a
        default is assigned by MechanismRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OptimizationControlMechanism; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of
        the constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).
