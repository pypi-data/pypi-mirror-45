It decreases the overhead required for cognitive modeling by providing standard building blocks (DDMS, Neural Nets, etc.) and the means to connect them together in a single environment. PsyNeuLink is designed to make the user think about computation in a \"mind/brain-like\" way while imposing minimal constraint on the type of models that can be implemented."
