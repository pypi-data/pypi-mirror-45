# RocketBase - library to test and retrain latest pre-trained ML models

Check out the tutorial at [GitHub](https://github.com/LucasVandroux/rockethub-tutorial1) to get started with our library.

Currently, we support Python 3 and Pytorch. More Libraries to come. If there is something you would like to use besides that write us at [hello@mirage.id](mailto:hello@mirage.id)
