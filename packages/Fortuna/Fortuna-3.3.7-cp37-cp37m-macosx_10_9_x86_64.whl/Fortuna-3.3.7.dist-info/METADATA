# Fortuna: Random Value Generator
Fortuna's main goal is to provide a quick and easy way to build custom random-value generators.

The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the RNG Storm engine. While Storm is a high quality random engine, Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is meant for games, data science, A.I. and experimental programming, not security.

Suggested Installation: `$ pip install Fortuna`

Installation on platforms other than MacOS may require building from source files.

    - Epsilon Below Zero: -5e-324
    - Epsilon Above Zero:  5e-324

##### Project Definitions:
- Value: Any python object: str, int, list and lambda to name a few.
- Callable: Any callable object, function, method or lambda.
- Sequence: Any object that can be converted into a list via `list(some_object)`.
    - List, Tuple, Set, etc...
    - Comprehensions and Generators that produce Sequences also qualify.
    - Classes that wrap a simple collection will take any Sequence or Array.
    - Functions that operate on a simple collection will require an Array.
- Array: List, tuple or any object that inherits from either.
    - Must be an object that is indexed like a list.
    - List comprehensions qualify as Arrays, but sets and list generators do not.
    - All Arrays are Sequences but not all Sequences are Arrays.
- Pair: Array of two Values.
- Table: Array of Pairs.
    - List of lists of two values each.
    - Tuple of tuples of two values each.
    - Generators that produce Tables also qualify.
    - The result of zip(list_1, list_2) also qualifies.
- Matrix: Dictionary of Arrays.
    - Generators or comprehensions that produces a Matrix also qualify.
- Inclusive Range.
    - `[1, 10] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
- Exclusive Range.
    - `(0, 11) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
- Partial Ranges.
    - `[1, 11) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
    - `(0, 10] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
- Automatic Flattening. 
    - All random value generators in Fortuna will recursively call or "flatten" callable objects returned from the dataset at call time. 
    - Un-callable objects or those that require arguments will be returned in an uncalled state without error. 
    - A callable that can be flattened is any class initializer, function, method or lambda so long as it requires no arguments, it will be automatically flattened. 
    - Mixing callable objects with un-callable objects is fully supported, but it can be a bit messy. 
    - Nested callable objects are fully supported. Because `lambda(lambda) -> lambda` fixes everything for arbitrary values of 'because', 'fixes' and 'everything'. 
    - To disable automatic flattening, pass the optional keyword argument `flat=False`.


## Value Generators: Functional
`Fortuna.random_value(data: Array, flat=True) -> Value`
- @param data :: Array of Values.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Produces a random value from the list with a wide uniform distribution.

```python
from Fortuna import random_value


data = ("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape", "Lime", "Orange")
print(random_value(data))  # prints a random value from the data, flat uniform distribution.
```

`Fortuna.cumulative_weighted_choice(weighted_table: Table, flat=True) -> Value`
- @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted Pairs. `[(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c")]`
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Produces a random value from the list with a custom distribution.

```python
from Fortuna import cumulative_weighted_choice


weighted_data = (
    (7, "Apple"),
    (11, "Banana"),
    (13, "Cherry"),
    (23, "Grape"),
    (26, "Lime"),
    (30, "Orange"),
)
print(cumulative_weighted_choice(weighted_data))
# prints a random value from the data, with probability based on cumulative weight.
```

`Fortuna.lazy_cat(data, range_to=0, func=random_index, flat=True) -> Value`
- The lazy_cat function is a more general form of the QuantumMonty class. Features dependency injection.
- @param data :: Array of Values.
- @param range_to :: Default is zero. Must be equal to or less than the length of data, this represents the size of the output distribution. When range_to == 0, the total length of data is used instead. This argument is passed to the input function to get a valid index into the data. When range_to is negative the back of the data will be considered the starting point.
- @param func :: Optional. Default is random_index. This callable must follow the ZeroCool method specifications. All built-in ZeroCool methods qualify.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Returns a random value from the data using the function you specify at call time.

`Fortuna.truffle_shuffle(data: list, flat=True) -> Value`
In-place micro-shuffle. Destructive. It is recommended to shuffle the list conventionally once before a series of truffle_shuffles.
- @param data :: list of Values. Must be a mutable list. For best results, each Value should be unique and the number of Values should be more than just a few.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Random value from the list with a wide uniform distribution. The average width of the output sequence will naturally scale up with the size of the list.

**Wide Uniform Distribution**: *"Wide"* refers to the average distance between consecutive occurrences of the same value in the output sequence. The goal of this type of distribution is to keep the output sequence free of clumps or streaks, while maintaining randomness and uniform probability. This is not the same as a *flat uniform distribution*. The two distributions should be statistically similar for any given set, but the output sequence repetitiveness will be very different.


## Value Generators: Classes
### TruffleShuffle
`Fortuna.TruffleShuffle(data: Sequence, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- In-place micro-shuffle. Non-destructive, copies the list_of_values.
- @param data :: Sequence of Values. Automatically shuffles once with Knuth B at instantiation.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Callable Instance.
    - @return :: Random value from the list with a wide uniform distribution, performs an internal micro-shuffle. Pop a Value for return then use front_poisson insert to randomly put it back near the front of the list. The relative width of the output sequence will naturally scale up with the size of the list.


#### TruffleShuffle, Basic Use
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


list_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(list_of_values)

print(truffle_shuffle())
```

#### Automatic Flattening
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


auto_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda: 1, lambda: 2, lambda: 3])
print(auto_flat())  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3.
# Note: the lambda will not be called until call time and stays dynamic for the life of the object.

un_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda: 1, lambda: 2, lambda: 3], flat=False)
print(un_flat()())  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3, mind the double-double parenthesis

auto_un_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda x: x, lambda x: x + 1, lambda x:  x + 2], flat=False)
# Note: flat=False is not required here because the lambdas can not be called without input x satisfied.
# It is still recommended to specify flat=False if non-flat output is intend.
print(auto_un_flat()(1))  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3, mind the double-double parenthesis

```


#### Mixing Static Objects with Callable Objects
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


""" With automatic flattening active, lambda() -> int can be treated as an int. """
mixed_flat = TruffleShuffle([1, 2, lambda: 3])  # this is fine and works as intended.
print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1, 2 or 3

mixed_un_flat = TruffleShuffle([1, 2, lambda: 3], flat=False) # this pattern is not recommended.
print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1, 2 or "Function <lambda at some_address>"
# This pattern is not recommended because you wont know the nature of what you get back.
# This is almost always not what you want, and it can give rise to messy logic in other areas of your code.
```


#### Dynamic Strings
To successfully express a dynamic string, and keep it dynamic, at least one level of indirection is required. Without an indirection the f-string would collapse into a static string too soon.

```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle, d


# d() is a simple dice function, d(n) -> [1, n] flat uniform distribution.
dynamic_strings = TruffleShuffle((
    # while the probability of all A == all B == all C, individual probabilities of each possible string will differ based on the number of possible outputs of each category.
    lambda: f"A{d(2)}",  # -> A1 - A2, each are twice as likely as any particular B, and three times as likely as any C.
    lambda: f"B{d(4)}",  # -> B1 - B4, each are half as likely as any particular A, and 3/2 as likely as any C.
    lambda: f"C{d(6)}",  # -> C1 - C6, each are 1/3 as likely as any particular A and 2/3 as likely of any B.
))

print(dynamic_strings())  # prints a random dynamic string, flattened at call time.

"""
Sample Distribution of 10,000 dynamic_strings():
    A1: 16.92%
    A2: 16.66%
    B1: 8.08%
    B2: 8.51%
    B3: 8.15%
    B4: 8.1%
    C1: 5.62%
    C2: 5.84%
    C3: 5.71%
    C4: 5.43%
    C5: 5.22%
    C6: 5.76%
"""
```


### QuantumMonty
`Fortuna.QuantumMonty(data: Sequence, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param data :: Sequence of Values.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Callable Object with Monty Methods for producing various distributions of the data.
    - @return :: Random value from the data. The instance will produce random values from the list using the selected distribution model or "monty". The default monty is the Quantum Monty Algorithm.

```python
from Fortuna import QuantumMonty


list_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
monty = QuantumMonty(list_of_values)

print(monty())               # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                             # uses the default Quantum Monty Algorithm.

print(monty.flat_uniform())  # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                             # uses the "uniform" monty: a flat uniform distribution.
                             # equivalent to random.choice(list_of_values).
```
The QuantumMonty class represents a diverse collection of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the output distribution is based on the method you choose. Generally speaking, each value in the sequence will have a probability that is based on its position in the sequence. For example: the "front" monty produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. Given enough samples the "front" monty will always converge to a 45 degree slope down for any list of unique values.

There are three primary method families: linear, gaussian, and poisson. Each family has three base methods; 'front', 'middle', 'back', plus a 'quantum' method that incorporates all three base methods. The quantum algorithms for each family produce distributions by overlapping the probability waves of the other methods in their family. The Quantum Monty Algorithm incorporates all nine base methods.

```python
import Fortuna


monty = Fortuna.QuantumMonty(
    ["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"]
)

# Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
# Each method has its own unique distribution model for the same data set.

""" Flat Base Case """
monty.flat_uniform()             # Flat Uniform Distribution

""" Geometric Positional """
monty.front_linear()        # Linear Descending, Triangle
monty.middle_linear()       # Linear Median Peak, Equilateral Triangle
monty.back_linear()         # Linear Ascending, Triangle
monty.quantum_linear()      # Linear Overlay, 3-way monty.

""" Gaussian Positional """
monty.front_gauss()         # Front Gamma
monty.middle_gauss()        # Scaled Gaussian
monty.back_gauss()          # Reversed Gamma
monty.quantum_gauss()       # Gaussian Overlay, 3-way monty.

""" Poisson Positional """
monty.front_poisson()       # 1/3 Mean Poisson
monty.middle_poisson()      # 1/2 Mean Poisson
monty.back_poisson()        # -1/3 Mean Poisson
monty.quantum_poisson()     # Poisson Overlay, 3-way monty.

""" Quantum Monty Algorithm """
monty()                     # Quantum Monty Algorithm, 9-way monty.
monty.quantum_monty()
```

### Weighted Choice: Custom Rarity
Weighted Choice offers two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where programmable rarity is desired. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values.

The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.

#### Cumulative Weight Strategy
`Fortuna.CumulativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted pairs.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Callable Instance
    - @return :: Random value from the weighted_table, distribution based on the weights of the values.

_Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_

```python
from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice


cum_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice([
    (7, "Apple"),
    (11, "Banana"),
    (13, "Cherry"),
    (23, "Grape"),
    (26, "Lime"),
    (30, "Orange"),  # same as relative weight 4 because 30 - 26 = 4
])

print(cum_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
```

#### Relative Weight Strategy
`Fortuna.RelativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted pairs.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Callable Instance
    - @return :: Random value from the weighted_table, distribution based on the weights of the values.

```python
from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice


population = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape", "Lime", "Orange"]
rel_weights = [7, 4, 2, 10, 3, 4]
rel_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice(zip(rel_weights, population))

print(rel_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
```

### FlexCat
`Fortuna.FlexCat(dict_of_lists: Matrix, key_bias="front_linear", val_bias="truffle_shuffle", flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param dict_of_lists :: Keyed Matrix of Value Sequences.
- @parm key_bias :: String indicating the name of the algorithm to use for random key selection.
- @parm val_bias :: String indicating the name of the algorithm to use for random value selection.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values. Automatic Flattening.
- @return :: Callable Instance
    - @param cat_key :: Optional. Default is None. Key selection by name. If specified, this will override the key_bias for a single call.
    - @return :: Value. Returns a random value generated with val_bias from a random sequence generated with key_bias.

FlexCat is like a two dimensional QuantumMonty.

The constructor takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms to be used to make random selections. The algorithm specified for selecting a key need not be the same as the one for selecting values. An optional key may be provided at call time to bypass the random key selection. Keys passed in this way must exactly match a key in the Matrix.

By default, FlexCat will use key_bias="front" and val_bias="truffle_shuffle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and it will truffle shuffle the sequence values. This config is known as TopCat, it produces a descending-step, micro-shuffled distribution sequence. Many other combinations are available.

Algorithmic Options: _See QuantumMonty & TruffleShuffle for more details._

    "Cat_A": ("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5"),
    "Cat_B": ("B1", "B2", "B3", "B4", "B5"),
    "Cat_C": ("C1", "C2", "C3", "C4", "C5"),
}
flex_cat = FlexCat(matrix_data, key_bias="front_linear", val_bias="flat_uniform")

flex_cat()  # returns a "flat_uniform" random value from a random "front_linear" weighted category.
flex_cat("Cat_B")  # returns a "flat_uniform" random value specifically from the "Cat_B" sequence.
```

### Random Index, ZeroCool Specification
ZeroCool Methods are used by lazy_cat via dependency injection to generate random indices with any distribution.

ZeroCool methods must have the following properties:
Any distribution model is acceptable, so long as: The method or function takes exactly one parameter N such that: The method returns a random int in range `[0, N)` for positive values of N, and returns a random int in range `[N, 0)` for negative values of N. This symmetry matches how python will naturally index a list from the back for negative index values or from the front for positive index values.

ZeroCool functions often have an interesting limit as size goes to zero. ZeroCool does not place requirements the output of this input limit. At higher levels of abstraction, inside classes that employ ZeroCool methods- zero is always a sentinel to indicate the full range. In that case the length of the list is sent to the ZeroCool method, not zero. However for those who enjoy thinking a little deeper, consider the following:

If given the fact that an empty range is never an option, we could design a better solution than failure for input zero. Calculus might suggest that both infinity and negative infinity are equally viable output for an input limit of zero, but both are inappropriate for indexing a list. However, if we map infinity to the back of the list and minus infinity to the front of the list, then the following might hold: `random_index(0) -> [-1, 0]`. This "Top or Bottom" solution is not required for a method to be ZeroCool compatible, it is just an interesting option. Other valid possibilities include: always return None or 0 or -1 or throw an exception or spawn nasal demons, however none of these seem terribly helpful or useful. At least the Top/Bottom solution accurately reflects the "off by one" symmetry of the domain mapping that defines ZeroCool methods in general.


```python
from Fortuna import random_index


some_list = [i for i in range(100)]

print(some_list[random_index(10)])  # prints one of the first 10 items of some_list, [0, 9]
print(some_list[random_index(-10)])  # prints one of the last 10 items of some_list, [90, 99]
```
