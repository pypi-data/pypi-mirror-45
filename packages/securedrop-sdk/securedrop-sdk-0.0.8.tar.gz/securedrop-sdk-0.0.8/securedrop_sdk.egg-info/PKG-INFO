Description: # Python SDK for SecureDrop

        This SDK provides a convenient Python interface to the [SecureDrop Journalist Interface API](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/journalist_api.html). The development of the SDK was primarily motivated by the creation of the [SecureDrop Workstation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation) based on Qubes OS.
        
        The SDK is currently used by the [SecureDrop Client](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) that is a component of the SecureDrop Workstation. When used in Qubes OS, the SDK uses the [securedrop-proxy](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-proxy) service, as the VM which runs the client does not have network access by design.
        
        **IMPORTANT:** This project is still under active development. We do not recommend using it in any production context.
