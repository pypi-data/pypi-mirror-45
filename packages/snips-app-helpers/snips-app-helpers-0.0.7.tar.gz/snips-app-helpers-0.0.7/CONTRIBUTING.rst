Development
===========

To set up `snips-app-helpers` for local development:

1. Fork `snips-app-helpers <https://github.com/dreamermind/snips-app-helpers>`_
   (look for the "Fork" button).
2. Clone your fork locally::

    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/snips-app-helpers.git

3. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, run all the checks, doc builder and spell checker with `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ one command::

    tox

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

If you need some code review or feedback while you're developing the code just make the pull request.

For merging, you should:

1. Include passing tests (run ``tox``) [1]_.
2. Update documentation when there's new API, functionality etc.
3. Add a note to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` about the changes.
4. Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

.. [1] If you don't have all the necessary python versions available locally you can rely on Travis - it will
       `run the tests <https://travis-ci.org/dreamermind/snips-app-helpers/pull_requests>`_ for each change you add in the pull request.

       It will be slower though ...

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    tox -e envname -- pytest -k test_myfeature

To run all the test environments in *parallel* (you need to ``pip install detox``)::

    detox
