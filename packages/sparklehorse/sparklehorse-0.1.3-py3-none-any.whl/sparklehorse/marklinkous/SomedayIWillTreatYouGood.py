There's something going on around here
I could not crawl back if I tried
I couldn't wait around
I couldn't wait another second
Something going on around here
I left my baby on the side of the highway
She just couldn't see things my way
Someday I will treat you good
Someday I will treat you fine
Someday I will treat you good
You know I should
Everything that's made is made to decay
Well I'm shrinking bones in the sun
Won't you tell me why that
The beautiful ones are always crazy
She's whispering like morticia now
I left my baby on the side of the road
I left her with a heavy load
Someday I will treat you good
Someday I will treat you fine
Someday I will treat you good
You know I should

London = """\
I wander through each chartered street,
near where the chartered Thames does flow,
and mark in every face I meet
marks of weakness, marks of woe
in every cry of every man,
in every infant's cry of fear,
in every voice, in every ban,
the mind-forged manacles I hear.
how the chimney-sweeper's cry
every blackening church appalls,
and the hapless soldier's sigh
runs in blood down palace walls
but most, through midnight streets I hear
how the youthful harlot's curse
blasts the new-born infant's tear
and blights with plagues the marriage hearse
I wander through each chartered street,
near where the chartered Thames does flow,
and mark in every face I meet
marks of weakness, marks of woe

The roof is leaking rust

I shot a man on sunday
Now I'm a fugitive on monday
Yeah, oh we're
In the dry
The sheriff on my trail
To escort me to jail
With bloodhounds fat and unhealthy
I may be cornered but I'm wealthy
Yeah, oh we're
In the dry
Yeah, oh we're
In the dry
I rise to meet my rivals
They shoot me with their rifles
Now I'm lying by a pool
On a blanket, moist and cool
Yeah, oh we're
