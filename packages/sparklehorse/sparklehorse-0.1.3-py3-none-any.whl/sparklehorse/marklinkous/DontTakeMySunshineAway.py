DontTakeMySunshineAway = """\
your face is like the sun sinking into the ocean
your face is like watching flowers growing in fast motion
all your kisses i swallowed
brightened mornings and hollows
my vines and tree knots will come unwound
baby you are my sunshine
my sunshine
please don’t take my sunshine away
the grounded fireflies are little stars that are dying
returning to the earth i can hear them crying
like christmas bulbs that i swallowed
slept in a tree that’s gone hollow
and never a brittle wintertime
baby you are my sunshine
my sunshine
please don’t take my sunshine away
solo
sunshine
my sunshine
please don’t take my sunshine away

Abide with me from the morning till the evening
Abide with me when the night is high
Be my last sight and sweet to rest
Forever on your warm decaying breast
See you blind
Behold your savior's come
Dance for death
You lame in the morning fires
And be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
When grace has purified my blindness
It could be fresh and new and glorious
Will my bleeding ears be rung with joy
Or are they just plain spent and well destroyed
See you blind
Behold your savior's come
Dance for death
You lame in the morning fires
And be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky

A flock of knives cut the sky
And buried in my black eyes
And the clouds they bled in my head
And autumn rains soaked the dry beds
And the hurricane of her eyes
Willed away the knives
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
And I did swallow stained glass tears
Absorbed by the sun for many light years
And the fireflies in her hair
My red concertina's coming down the stairs
And the hurricane of her eyes
Willed away the knives
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
