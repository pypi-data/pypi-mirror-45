KnivesOfSummertime = """\
A flock of knives cut the sky
And buried in my black eyes
And the clouds they bled in my head
And autumn rains soaked the dry beds
And the hurricane of her eyes 
Willed away the knives
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
And I did swallow stained glass tears
Absorbed by the sun for many light years
And the fireflies in her hair
My red concertina's coming down the stairs
And the hurricane of her eyes
Willed away the knives
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime
Summertime
The knives of summertime

Caroline = """\
Fire on the brain
Crooked memory craned
Lunar pulling stone
Stardust in my bones
Like we were never born
Like ghosts out in the corn
And the rain curtains raised
Things that don't have names
Caroline, caroline
Caroline, caroline
And all my food was tears
And so with us old years
Like a dancer with a bad heart
Pray it never starts
Caroline, caroline
Caroline, caroline
Caroline, caroline
Caroline, caroline
