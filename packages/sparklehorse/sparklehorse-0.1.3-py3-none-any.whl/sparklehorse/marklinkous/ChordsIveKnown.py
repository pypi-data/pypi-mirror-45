she laid her head
on my chest
as the sun burned
down the west
there\"s one thing we still got
this one last dance in this parking lot
oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness
oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness
then she woke up
into the fire
and the flames kept
dancing higher
satan would laugh at her screams
then she woke up from her dreams
oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness
oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness

Without you last night
Fireworks show bright
And I almost lost my mind
Yes I almost lost my mind
In the traffic jam
Sweating big for cans
And I almost lost my mind
Yes I almost lost my mind
For the queue last night
Fireworks show bright
And I almost lost my mind
Yes I almost lost my mind

There is a dead opera star
Floating in the great dismal swamp
And he was wearing a dress with watermelons on it
And he stuffed his bra with spanish moss
Dead opera star
Dead opera star
Dead opera star
Floating in the great dismal swamp
Black tupelo
Where all the planets beyond goes to die
The air hangs thick with dead electricity
He was chased by ball lightning
Went crazy from sleeping under the moonlight
And the soul of a unbaptised infant
He swims the waters upsetting boats
Dead opera star
Dead opera star
Dead opera star
Floating in the great dismal swamp

There's too much confusion today
How can I assure it's to shy away
And he blew his brains out with a pistol I say
To cover his arse or make a point someway
Meet me on lonely street
Meet me on lonely street now
Stabbed me in the back you know she threw a hatchet
Buried in my chest when I turned to catch it
And my lucky days are stuck in quarantine
I thought I got some kind of warranty
Meet me on lonely street
Meet me on lonely street
Meet me on lonely street
Meet me on lonely street
