please don’t take my sunshine away
the grounded fireflies are little stars that are dying
returning to the earth i can hear them crying

slept in a tree that’s gone hollow

I could look in your face
For a thousand years
It’s like a civil war
Of pain and of cheer
But if you was a horse
I could help you with your chains
I could ride you through the fields
By your fiery mane
May your shade be sweet
And float upon the lakes
Where the sun will be
Made of honey
I grab diamonds, write you a poem
'Cause no one here can save you
She’s returning to the Earth
But one day she’ll be silver
Stars are dying in my chest
Till I see you again
She was born with the wings of a hawk
Where she combs her hair with blood

Made of honey

Born to return back to the clay
