On vacation not unlike your very own
And the Captain Howdy lit, upon my shoulder
And he left me with sulfur,
and rooms full of headaches
I fell in with snakes,
in the poisoned ranks of strangers

Will my pony recognize my voice in hell?
Will he still be blind or do they go by smell?
Will you promise me not to rest me out at sea?
But on a fiery river boat that's rickety
I'll never find my pony along the rolling swells
A muddy river or a lake would do me well
With hints of amber sundowns
and muted thunderstorms
A sunken barge's horns with the cold rusty bells
