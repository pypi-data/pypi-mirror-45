all you`ve got to do is look in the sky and wish
you might see his face in the clouds or relaxing in a spirit ditch
he`s been known to sleep on piles of dry leaves
abandoned on October lawns
sometimes he awakens with spiders on his eyelids
rainmaker`s coming
rainmaker`s coming
rainmaker`s coming to soak us with water
sometimes you feel just like a stone tossed into the deep
all you gotta do is touch a woman#s face that#s warm with sleep
and he can show up at your, your back door in the deep
trace him back before he was born
inquiring about an honest days work for a decent meal
rainmaker`s coming
rainmaker`s coming
rainmaker`s coming to soak us with water
sometimes he`s hitching a ride in a freezer or appears as a mist
he#s also been known to introduce himself as a scientist
he could be the retarded son of an old woman with
seven fingers on each hand
`cos I know I reckon, he will come when he`s beckoned for
rainmaker`s coming
rainmaker`s coming
rainmaker`s coming to soak us with water
to soak us with water

You left at my door
Set 'em in a broken glass

Four ton deaf and dumb
