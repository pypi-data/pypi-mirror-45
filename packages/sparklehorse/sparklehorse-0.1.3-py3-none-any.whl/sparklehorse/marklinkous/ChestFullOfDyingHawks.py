I want my records back
And that motorcycle gas tank
That I, spraypainted black
The owls have been talking to me

A burnt out basement
Sleeping with
Metal hands
In a spirit ditch
The moon it will rise with such
Horse laughter
It's dragging pianos to the ocean
If I had a home
You'd know it'd be
In a slide trombone

I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes

Fiery pianos wash up on a foggy coast
Squeaky old organs have given up the ghost
Fire them up and kill the piano birds
There's creaky old organs burning on the coast

I wander through each chartered street,

marks of weakness, marks of woe
in every cry of every man,
in every infant's cry of fear,
in every voice, in every ban,
the mind-forged manacles I hear.
how the chimney-sweeper's cry
every blackening church appalls,
and the hapless soldier's sigh
runs in blood down palace walls
but most, through midnight streets I hear
how the youthful harlot's curse
blasts the new-born infant's tear
and blights with plagues the marriage hearse

Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage

How I wish how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found
The same old fears

Year after year
