well I\'ll bet my Maria\'s got an elbow full of lonely
now here\'s a little prayer so that she might get some sleep
don\'t let her face get skinned by the sun today
don\'t let it in when it comes knocking at your door

loneliness
loneliness
loneliness
oh oh

sometimes you feel you\'ve got the emptiest arms in the whole world
try to make sense but it always comes out absurd
sleeping horses keep eating up your flowers
don\'t let it in when it comes kicking at your door

loneliness
loneliness
loneliness
oh
came kicking at my door

she said I\'ve really come to hate my body
and all the things that it requires in this world
I bet you\'re out there getting drunk with all your friends
and it\'ll get you in the bathroom of a texaco

loneliness
loneliness
loneliness
oh
came kicking at my door

Wish You Were Here
So,so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell,blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish,how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,year after year,
Running over the same old ground.What have you found?The same old fears.
Wish you were here.
