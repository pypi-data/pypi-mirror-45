"""
An Object is represented by a transformation matrix representing itâ€™s position
in 3-space, as well as a collection of Assets (Mesh files, Texture files,
Shader scripts, etc.). Objects are meant to be interacted with by individual
devices, and these changes will be streamed to all devices via the
Event API. This API exposes CRUD and Query operations for Objects.

Objects may also have a frame/timestamp, as well as animation graph handles.
Both of these are, however, optional.

:key: The Unique ID of the Object, assigned by Aesel.
:name: The Name of the Object.
:scene: The ID of the Scene which contains the Object.
:type: The type of the object (ie. "mesh", "curve", etc).
:subtype: The subtype of the object (ie. "cube", "sphere", etc).
:frame: The integer frame of the object
:transform: The transformation matrix of the object, in a single array.  The first four elements make up the first row of the matrix, and this pattern continues.
:actions: An array of AeselAction instances.
