        Small tools to interface with search engine form the command line that has tight integration with the linux X clipboard.
        
        For python 3 installs:
        
        `sudo apt install surfraw surfraw-extra xclip python3-tk`
        
        For python 2
        
        `sudo apt install surfraw surfraw-extra xclip python-tk`
        
        install with `pip install .` or `pip install search-cli`
        
        Programs:
        
         * `search` or `sr`: Search from the command line with a backoff to search for what ever is on your clipboard if you don't type anything
         * `search_highlighted`: Search for the highlighted span.
         * `search_gui`: Create a text input box and search for entered text with `<Enter>`
         * `search_gui_highlighted`: Same as above but seeded with the currently highlighted text.
        
        `search_highlighted`, `search_gui`, and `search_gui_highlighted` are ideal for keybinding.
        
        When the search bar loses focus (you click away) it will automatically close. If you don't like this behavior you can set `SR_CLOSE_LOSS_FOCUS` to `no` to stop it.
        
        Windows:
        
        On windows only searching with google is supported. To run you will need python installed
        and the entry point scripts exectuable. This normally involes adding paths like the
        following to your path (`control panel` -> `System and Security` -> `System` -> `Advanced system settings` -> `Environment Variables`)
        
         C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts
         C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32
         
        On windows I can't get the selected text the same way I can on Linux so there are
        `autoHotKey` scripts in the `win` folder than can simulate this behavior.
