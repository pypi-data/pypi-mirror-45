# pdml2flow [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pdml2flow.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pdml2flow) 
_Aggregates wireshark pdml to flows, with plugins_

When analyzing network traffic, it is sometimes helpful to group captured frames. For example by port numbers to obtain network flows or using MAC addresses for hardware flows. Doing this in [Wireshark][wireshark] or [tshark] is difficult. `pdml2flow` was designed to solve this use case. `pdml2flow` reads [tshark] output using the [Packet Description Markup Language][pdml] and writes flows either in JSON or XML. These flows are also accessible from a python plugin interface. If flow aggregation is not needed, `pdml2frame` can be be used to process [pdml] with plugins.

  - 3.5
  - 3.5-dev
  - 3.6
  - 3.6-dev
  - 3.7-dev
  - nightly
* [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

## Installation

```shell
$ sudo pip install pdml2flow
```

## Usage

```shell
$ pdml2flow -h
usage: pdml2flow [-h] [--version] [-f FLOW_DEF_STR] [-t FLOW_BUFFER_TIME]
                 [-l DATA_MAXLEN] [-c] [-a] [-s] [-d] [+json [args]]
                 [+xml [args]]

Aggregates wireshark pdml to flows

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --version            Print version and exit
  -f FLOW_DEF_STR      Fields which define the flow, nesting with: '.'
                       [default: ['vlan.id', 'ip.src', 'ip.dst', 'ipv6.src',
                       'ipv6.dst', 'udp.stream', 'tcp.stream']]
  -t FLOW_BUFFER_TIME  Lenght (in seconds) to buffer a flow before writing the
                       packets [default: 180]
  -l DATA_MAXLEN       Maximum lenght of data in tshark pdml-field [default:
                       200]
  -c                   Removes duplicate data when merging objects, will not
                       preserve order of leaves [default: False]
  -a                   Instead of merging the frames will append them to an
                       array [default: False]
  -s                   Extract show names, every data leaf will now look like
                       { raw : [] , show: [] } [default: False]
  -d                   Debug mode [default: False]

Plugins:
  +json [args]         usage: JSON output [-h] [-0] optional arguments: -h,
                       --help show this help message and exit -0 Terminates
                       lines with null character
  +xml [args]          usage: XML output [-h] [-0] optional arguments: -h,
                       --help show this help message and exit -0 Terminates
                       lines with null character
```

### Environment Variables

| Name | Descripton |

## Examples

Sniff from interface and write json:
```shell
$ tshark -i interface -Tpdml | pdml2flow +json
```

Read a .pcap file
```shell
$ tshark -r pcap_file -Tpdml | pdml2flow +json
```

Aggregate based on ethernet source and ethernet destination address
```shell
$ tshark -i interface -Tpdml | pdml2flow -f eth.src -f eth.dst +json
```

Pretty print flows using [jq]

$ tshark -i interface -Tpdml | pdml2flow +json | jq
```

Post-process flows using [FluentFlow]
```shell
$ tshark -i interface -Tpdml | pdml2flow +json | fluentflow rules.js
```
