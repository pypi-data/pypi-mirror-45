# TSL â€“ Text Scraping Language
Python package for processing of a scraping language in pseudo-code

*The TSL Python package allows you to write and execute pseudo-code style language to process text files with Regular expressions and simple logic. This gives an easy entry to data mining to non-programmers.*

You can either run it as a CLI using `python TSL.py myScript.tsl` or use the **TSLEngine class** like this:

```python
from TSLEngine import TSLEngine

TSL = TSLEngine('myScript.tsl')

if TSL.task:
    TSL.run()
```

## Example:
![Sublime Text Syntax Highlighting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polygoat/TSL/master/preview.png "Sublime Text Syntax Highlighting")

... This will read all lines from `stats/milestones.csv`, take all lines, splits them into columns, selects the second column and saves the corresponding row into a file labeled by said column (e.g. `stats/31-03-2019.txt`).

# How does it work?
TSL runs through the script line by line and executes corresponding Python code in the background. File handling, complex data types, and templating are built-in for rapid prototyping. Every line starts with a command followed by a space and space-separated arguments. 
Most commands support optional clauses like `as ...` (storage variable) or `in ...` (file handle) to supply further information.

A command's inputs and outputs can be **strings** or **collections of strings**. In ladder case, TSL iterates over a collection's strings and applies the command to each of them. The commands `as`, `remember`, `split`, and `for every` loops change the context to the provided variable. This means you can omit `as` clauses in the following commands, always automatically referring to the context. To reference variables rather than strings use square brackets. `log something` will log the string "something", while `log [something]` will log the content of the variable called _something_.

# Available TSL Commands

## File & system operations

### bash `<command>` as `<variable>`
*Runs a bash command and saves the returned output to a variable.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    bash git branch as branches
```

### empty `[<filepath>]`
*Opens up a file and deletes all its content.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in wordbag.txt
    	empty
```

### in *`<path/to/textfile.txt>`*
*Opens up a file and reads all its lines. You can log the lines using `log line`
All future file operations are refering to this one until your next "in" statement.
You'll usually see this followed by a `take` or `find all` command*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in stats/01092019.txt
```

### in *`<path/to/folder>`*
*Creates the nested directory structure if it doesn't exist. Otherwise, the path will be used as context for future operations.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in "/Sublime Text/Packages"
        count files as fileCount
        log [fileCount]
```

### save `[as <filepath>]`
*Saves the latest collection in the given filename.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    save as runner/cleaned_userinputs.txt
```

### write `[<variable>]`
*Writes given variable (or the results of the last `find all`) into the last file opened with `in`*

**Example:**
```fortran
    write [userIds]
```

### add *`<string | variable>`* [to `<filepath>`]
*Appends content to a file different from the currently open one*

**Example:**
```fortran
    add [libraries] to libs.txt
```

---
## Selections

### select nth [of `[input]`]
*Selects a specific item of a collection, given its index.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in bigrams.txt   
        select 4th
```


### select words [of `[input]`][as `<output>`]
*Selects all words found in the last opened file.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in utterances.txt	
    	select words
```

### select [from *`<string | RegEx | int>`*] [to *`<string | RegEx | int>`*]
*Selects the range from the indicated string/RegEX/number until the indicated string or regular expression or number. Note that we start counting with 1 to keep it natural*

**Example:**
```fortran
    select from "accessibilityApp" to "[v:"
    select from \s to \s
    select from 1 to "[v:samsung.tvSearchAndPlay.Genres:drama]"
    select two of [bigrams]
```

### select from `<string | RegEx | integer>`
*Selects the range from the indicated string / regular expression / number until the end of the line*

****Example:**
```fortran
    select from "dateTime"
    select from \d\d\d
    select from 122 
```

### select to `<string | RegEx | integer>`
*Selects the range from the beginning of the line to the indicated string / regular expression / number.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    select to "dateTime"
    select to \W
    select to 5th  
    select to 370  
```

## Debugging & calculations

### be `<property>`
*Sets one of the following properties of TSL to true:*

`verbose` | `active`

### calculate `operation` as `<variable>`
*Calculates mathematical operations*

**Example:**
```fortran
    calculate (5 * 4) / 2 as ratio
```

### log *`<variable | string>`*
*Prints to the console. Use strings with template tags (e.g. "here is: [varName]") for variables*

### count `<variable>` as `<countVariable>`
*Stores the count of lines in a selection.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    count [entries-per-day] as frequency
    log [frequency]
```

### count *`<files | folders>`* in `<path/to/dir>` as `<countVariable>`
*Stores the count of files or folders in a directory.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    count files in "C:\Windows" as systemFiles
    log "Exactly [systemFiles] system files found."
```

---
## Manipulation

### change `<varName>` to `<formula>`
*Iterates over a collection and changes all entries according to the template tag. Use brackets to tag variables, like so: `[varName]`*

**Example:**
```fortran
    change [salute] to "Hi, [salute] #[i]"
```
*will e.g. change "my name is Dan" to "Hi, my name is Dan #1"*

### combine `<setName>` with `<setName>` as `<varName>`
*Merges two sets and stores it in a new variable.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    combine [vowels] with [consonants] as letters
```

### find all *`<string | RegEx>`* [in `<varName>`] [as `<varName>`]
*Finds all occurrences of a string or regular expression in the lines of the currently open file or a stored collection. The results of this search are automatically stored in a variable `found`*

Example:
```fortran
    in corpus_de.txt
    	take lines as utterances
    	find all [aeiou]+ in [utterances]
    	log [found]
```

### remove lines
*Removes the last selected lines (e.g. the ones found using a `find all`)*

### replace *`<string | RegEx>`* by `<string>` [in `<variable>`]
*Replaces given string or regular expression by another string, optionally in a particular collection.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    replace \W+ by "_"
```

### sort [`<varName>`]

*Sorts either the supplied or last referenced collection alphanumerically (in ascending order).*

### split *`<string|RegEx>`* by `<delimiter>` as `<variable>`
Splits a string into a collection using delimiter.

**Example:**
```fortran
    split apples;bananas;oranges by ; as fruits
    log [fruits]
```

### unique lines
*Removes all duplicate lines from the last referenced collection.*

## Memory

### remember *`<string | variable>`* as `<variableName>`
*Stores a string or variable in a new variable.*

### take *`<lines | results | files | folders>`* [as `<name>`]
*Changes the selected collection to whole lines (`take lines as ...`), results of a `find all` directive, or to the files found in a folder specified with a preceding `in <folderPath>` directive.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in source.txt
    	find all <[^>]+>
    	take lines as htmlLines
    	log [htmlLines]
    
    in libraries/de
    	take files as germanLibs
    	log [germanLibs]
```

---
## Flow

### for every `<variable>`
### ---

*Loops through a collection, populating the variable `i` with the current index. From within the loop, the item of the collection can be accessed using the variable name in singular (books -> book, babies -> baby).*

*If a collection is empty, the for-loop is skipped. This becomes useful to create conditional flows.*

*Always terminate a loop with three consecutive hyphens in a separte line.*

**Example:**
```fortran
    in corpus.txt
    	find all [^\b]+\b[^\b]+ as bigrams
    	for every [bigram]
    		log "#[i]: [bigram]"
    	---
```

### run `path/to/script.tsl`
*Runs another TSL file*

The external TSL file will receive the same scope as inlined code.

---
# Templating

Templates are enclosed in square brackets and can appear in quoted strings, file paths, and even within regular expressions:
```fortran
{
    remember "\CommNetwork" as domain
    in user.txt
        find all \b[domain][^:]: as user
        for every [user]
            select from 0 to -1
            in "/users/[user]/credentials.txt"
                change [user] to "[user]:pleaseresetme"
                add [user]
        ---
}
```
If the variables can not be found, the template tags remain untouched, including square brackets. This allows us to easily mix them in with regular expressions.
