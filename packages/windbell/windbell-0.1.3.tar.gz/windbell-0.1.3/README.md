**Windbell is still under early development. Issues or pull requests are welcome!**

# Concept

**Windbell** requires no system or user level configuration, and produce nothing after installation either. All you need is a [**windfile**](https://github.com/HawkinsZhao/windbell/blob/master/docs/windfile.md). So, you could just place it to where you need, then run `windbell send`.

For example, if you want to send email in a CI pipeline of a git repo, you could just place your windfile in the root of your repo, then use a [windbell docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/hawkinszhao/windbell) to send the email. See our instructions about [integration](https://github.com/HawkinsZhao/windbell/blob/master/docs/integrate.md).
