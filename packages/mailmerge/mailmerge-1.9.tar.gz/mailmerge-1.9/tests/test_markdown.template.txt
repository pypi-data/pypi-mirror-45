Hi, **{{name}}**,

You can add:

- Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
- Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
- Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
- Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
- Unordered lists like this one.
- Ordered lists with numbers:
    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2
- Preformatted text with `backticks`.

# This is a heading.
## And another heading.
How about some [hyperlinks](http://bit.ly/eecs485-wn19-p6)?

Or code blocks?

```
print("Hello world.")
```
