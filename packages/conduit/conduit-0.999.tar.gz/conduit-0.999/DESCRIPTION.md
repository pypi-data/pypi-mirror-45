# Conduit

**Python stream transformation package for common Power Engineering analytics.**

Package coming soon!

## Notes

For users of conduit v0.0.8 or earlier, a framework for dataflow-style python programming, the versions are still maintained here. Starting with version 1.0 the new conduit package is a power engineering analytics library that also has dataflow-like properties. We would like to say a special thank you to [@sleibman](https://github.com/sleibman) for allowing us to take over this namespace for our project!
