Description: PyWarble
        ########
        PyWarble provides Python classes that wrap around the exported functions of the `Warble <https://github.com/mbientlab/Warble>`_ 
        C library.  
        
        Install
        #######
        Use ``pip`` to install the warble package.  
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install warble
            
        As this project requires compiling the ``warble`` C library, you will need to configure your target machine to have the 
        appropriate build environment before running ``pip`` as described in warble's 
        `README <https://github.com/mbientlab/Warble/blob/master/README.md#build>`_.  
        
        Windows
        =======
        The setup script will build the dll with ``MSBuild``.  Make sure your ``Path`` system variable has an entry pointing to the 
        ``MSBuild`` executable and that you have the necessary 
        `Windows 10 SDK <https://github.com/mbientlab/Warble/blob/master/README.md#windows-10>`_ installed.  
        
        Linux
        =====
        Install the required tools and packages detailed in the `Linux <https://github.com/mbientlab/Warble/blob/master/README.md#linux>`_ 
        build section.
        
        Usage
