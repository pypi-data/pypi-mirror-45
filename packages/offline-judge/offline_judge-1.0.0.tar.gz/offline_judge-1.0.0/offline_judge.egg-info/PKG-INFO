Description: # Offline Judge
        An offline equivalent of an online judge in Python. Unfortunately, it uses many Unix-exclusive features. This is in theory compatible with Unix-likes, however, it is only tested on Linux 4.12.3.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        $ pip install offline-judge
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        $ judge --help
        usage: judge [-h] [--no-ansi]
                     test_cases time_limit memory_limit executable
                     [{standard,floats,identical}]
        
        An quick offline judging tool.
        
        positional arguments:
          test_cases            Directory that contains the test cases, where the
                                input is in a file ending with `.in` and the
                                corresponding output in a file with the same name
                                ending with `.out`.
          time_limit            Time limit in seconds. Decimals are accepted. Note
                                that this limit can be bypassed by catching SIGXCPU.
          memory_limit          Memory limit in one of "B", "K", "M", "G", "T". This
                                must be one continuous string, for example "5M" is
                                valid, however, "5 M" is not. Keep in mind that this
                                has to be a multiple of the architecture's page size.
          executable            The executable to run. It is executed through the
                                execve system call. Therefore, scripts starting with
                                "#!/bin/sh" will work, though it is a questionable
                                language choice. Additional languages can be supported
                                through helper scripts.
          {standard,floats,identical}
                                Checker to be used to compare the correct output and
                                the executable output. (default: standard)
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --no-ansi             disable ANSI output
        ```
        
        The judge outputs one line for every case, indicating the test case name/id, verdict and the memory/cpu usage. A final line is then appended, indicating the number of cases passed, the final verdict, the maximum memory usage on any test case, and the total/max time usage.
        
        Note: The memory usage is given in this format: "256p/1M", where 256 is the number of memory pages used.
