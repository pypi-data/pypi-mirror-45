# SynthTool (for client libraries)

This tool helps to generate and layout cloud client libraries. 

## Installation

This tool requires Python 3.6. Either install it from python.org or use
pyenv to get 3.6.


```
# Install latest

python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/googleapis/synthtool.git

# Install stable
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade gcp-synthtool
```

## Basic usage

### Python

To start the process of generation, we need to clone the destination repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:googleapis/google-cloud-python.git
cd google-cloud-python
cd {cloud-package}
```

If a `synth.py` script is not present at the root of the package, we will need
to author a synth.py script. You can grab one from another package 
(for instance tasks in python) or start from scratch.

We run synthtool as follows:
```
python3 -m synthtool
```

Once you run synthtool without errors:
- Investigate the changes it made just to be certain everything looks reasonable
- run the unit tests (nox)
- commit and push the changes to a branch and open a PR!

### Node.js
Node.js generation is similar to python. For an example `synth.py` you can look at https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-speech/blob/master/synth.py.

### Ruby
- TODO. Should be similar to Python


## Features
### Templating
Synthtool supports template files using jinja. As an example let's look at node.js. The templates for node can be found at `/synthtool/gcp/templates/node_library/`. The following is taken from a node.js synth script.

```
common_templates = gcp.CommonTemplates()

templates = common_templates.node_library(package_name="@google-cloud/speech")
s.copy(templates)
```

`package_name` is a keyword arg that is used by a jinja template. Jinja uses `{{ package_name }}` to customize the template for a specific package. You can add additionaly keyword args as necessary.

### googleapis-private
Synthtool supports generation from googleapis/googleapis-private. 

```
gapic = gcp.GAPICGenerator()
library = gapic.node_library('speech', 'v1', private=True)
```
2FA is required to clone a private repo. 

* **Using SSH:** Before running Synthtool, set the environment variable `AUTOSYNTH_USE_SSH` to `true`. The repo will be cloned using SSH.
* **Using HTTPS:** Generate a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with scope `repo`. Run synthtool. When GitHub prompts for your GitHub password, provide the access token instead.
```

```

### Artman Version
Synthtool uses the latest version of the [Artman Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/googleapis/artman). You can change this by setting the environment variable `SYNTHTOOL_ARTMAN_VERSION` to the desired version tag.

```
export SYNTHTOOL_ARTMAN_VERSION=0.16.2
```

### Local Googleapis
Synthtool supports generation from a local copy of googleapis. Specify the path to`googleapis` in the environment variable `SYNTHTOOL_GOOGLEAPIS`.

```
export SYNTHTOOL_GOOGLEAPIS=path/to/local/googleapis
```


## Helpful tips
### Where does the generated code go?
Synthtool will run [Artman](https://hub.docker.com/r/googleapis/artman) which will create generated code that can be found at `~/.cache/synthtool/googleapis<-private>/artman_genfiles`. This is useful for figuring out what it is you need to copy for your specific library.
