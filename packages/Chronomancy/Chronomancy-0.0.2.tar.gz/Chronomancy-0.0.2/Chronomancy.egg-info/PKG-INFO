Description: # Chronomancy
        A Python library for re-calling methods (or class properties) from within a method that they were initially passed in as an argument for.
        
        For those who fancy dramatic and poetic descriptions (like me)...
        
        _"We are piercing the veil of the Stack, using echos in time to reconstruct a pathway through memory, finding their source and recasting the spell."_
