    This is some super sneaky shit.

    And I know!  I know!  "You're not supposed to mess with the stack, it's a bad idea, there be dragons!!!"

    Blah blah blah.

    Look!  If you're not willing to push some limits while being as mindful as you can be, you're never going
    to get ahead in life.  You already know this, so stop being such a baby!  We have frontiers to cross and
    dragons to slay!

    With that said, here's what I'm doing (currently).

    Let's say that you're calling a method which is taking another method as an input parameter.

    The return value of the input parameter method is acquired first and then passed into the scope of
    the calling method.

    Once the returned value of the input parameter method is calculated and passed into the calling method's
    scope, it is it's own thing in memory.  Whatever that value is, that's the only value it will ever be and
    it does not contain within it any knowledge of what originally created (returned) it ancestrally.

    So, one might ask, how can you find out what created/returned the value that was passed in to the calling
    method from the input parameter method?

    And, more importantly, how can you re-call/re-access the object which gave us the value passed into our
    calling function?

    Yes, you could simply pass in the pointer to the method which you might want to re-call and that would be easy,
    BUT, that only really works for functions.  It doesn't work for class instance properties, not in any way that
    is clean, intuitive to use, and doesn't require the user to do more work than they should have to.

    What we really want is something that can be completely dynamic and figure out everything for us.

    That's what this method is for.  It does all of the magic for you of determining the if what we need to recall
    is a class method (which needs to be called using parentheses), or a class instance property.

    Furthermore, if what we want to recall is at the end of a dot-notation chain, this method will do what it
    needs to do to traverse the objects in this notation chain within the calling frames' local scope until it
    gets to the bottom of the chain in order to call/access the target.

    Args:
        calling_frame (Any):
        target_argument_pos (int):

    Returns:
        The a new return value of the argument passed in the method from the calling frame.
