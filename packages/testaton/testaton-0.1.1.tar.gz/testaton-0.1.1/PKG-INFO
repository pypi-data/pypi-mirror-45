Description: The json file (test_definitions.json) contains the configuration of the data elements and the tests that need to be executed. 
        
        There are 2 main types of connections:
        * Database connections
        * File connections (this will be subdivided into local and S3)
        
        The data definition defines one of 3 things:
        * A database table
        * A file (csv or parquet)
        * A database query
        
        The tests define the tests that can be executed. Currently there are 2 types of tests implemented:
        * Uniqueness - check for the uniqueness of a field
        * Foreign Key constraint - check for a key not existing 
        
        
        ## Requirements for the current test file
        
        * Local installation of spark
        * Postgres and table setup
        
        
        ## Execution 
        
        * Fix this part of the tests_processor.py script according to your installation of Dtest 
        ```
        sys.path.append('../../../dtest')
        from dtest.dtest import Dtest
        ```
        
        * `python tests_processor.py ./tests/test_definitions.json`
        
        
        ## TODO
        
        - [x] add timing calculation to the execution of the test
        - [ ] complete Dtest integration to the suite (sending the message) 
        - [ ] add code tests
        - [ ] remove username and password from test file
        - [ ] add a score function test against two variables from two data sets
        - [ ] filter : a number is out of range (e.g. mileage < 0)
        - [ ] count of yesterday's record > today + 10%
        - [x] count of null fields > amount
        - [ ] clean up code
        - [ ] create generic sql test
        - [ ] cross environment test execution (e.g. a table in a database and a file in parquet)
        ```
