KloudBuster version 7
=====================

How good is your OpenStack **data plane** or **storage service** under real
heavy load?

KloudBuster is a tool that can load the data plane or storage infrastructure of
any OpenStack cloud at massive scale and measure how well the cloud behaves
under load where it matters: from the VMs standpoint, where cloud applications
run.

Accessible to anybody with basic knowledge of OpenStack, installs in minutes
and runs off the box with sensible default workloads in a fully automated way.
CLI/REST or Web User Interface.. you pick what works best for you.
