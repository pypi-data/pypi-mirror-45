Description: # pipe2codeblock
        
        Pipe text into a code block in a markdown file.
        
        Originally designed for putting a terminal command's `--help` text into a `README.md`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Put a fenced codeblock in your target file with the info string `help`.
        
        The fenced codeblock is defined as it is by [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#fenced-code-blocks),
        with the exception that it cannot be indented (to prevent spaces being lstripped inside the block).
        
        Then do 
        
        ```bash
        your_awesome_tool --help | p2c README.md
        ```
        
        to pipe the text in, or
        
        ```bash
        p2c README.md input_file.txt
        ```
        
        to read from a file.
        
        The `--tgt` option allows you to choose which info string to target (instead of `"help"`).
        Only the first instance will be used.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```help
        usage: p2c [-h] [--tgt TGT] outfile [infile]
        
        Pipe text into a code block in a markdown file.
        
        positional arguments:
          outfile
          infile
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          --tgt TGT   Target a code block with a different info string (default
                      'help')
        ```
