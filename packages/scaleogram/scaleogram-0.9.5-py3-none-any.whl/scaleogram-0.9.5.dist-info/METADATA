# scaleogram

Scaleogram is a user friendly plot tool for 1D data analysis with Continuous Wavelet Transform
built on the [PyWavelets library](https://github.com/PyWavelets/pywt).  

I started this project when realizing how harsh it can be to build nice plots
of wavelets scaleogram with axes ticks and labels consistent with the actual location of features.
Hence this module aim to provide a reliable tool for either quick data analysis or publication.

It has the following features:

* simple call signature for complete beginners

* readable axes and clean matplotlib integration

* many options for changing scale, spectrum filter, colorbar integration, etc...

* support for periodicity and frequency units, consistent with labelling

* speed, uses a N*log(N) algorithm for transforms

* portability: tested with python2.7 and python3.7

* comprehensive error messages and documentation with examples

* support for Cone Of Influence mask

## Install with pip

Installation should be straightforward with

```
pip install scaleogram
```

## Install from github

```
git clone http://github.com/alsauve/scaleogram
cd scaleogram
python ./setup.py install --user
```

### Prerequisites

This module depends on

* PyWavelet >= 1.0
* matplotlib >= 2.0
* numpy >= 1.0

## Documentation

A lot of documentation and examples are available online from the docstrings

Jupyter notebook are also provided for quickstarting

* A gentle introduction to CWT based data analysis [TODO]
* [scale to frequency relationship](https://github.com/alsauve/scaleogram/blob/master/doc/scale-to-frequency.ipynb)
* [Example of scaleogram with the NINO3.4 SST seasonal time series](https://github.com/alsauve/scaleogram/blob/master/doc/El-Nino-Dataset.ipynb)
* [Graphical output of the test set](https://github.com/alsauve/scaleogram/blob/master/doc/tests.ipynb)


## Running the tests

A features test matrix can be plotted with

```
# launch graphical tests
python -m scaleogram.test
```

## Built With

* [ViM](https://www.vim.org/) - The editor
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - The Scientific Python Developement Environment
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - The Jupyter Notebook
