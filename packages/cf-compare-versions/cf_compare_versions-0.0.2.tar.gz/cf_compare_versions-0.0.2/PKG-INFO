        >
        > The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one is greater than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: “1.2” is greater than “1.1”. Please provide all test cases you could think of.

        ### The Answer
        
        source directory: `./compare_versions`
        
        - Run `pip3 install cf_compare_versions`
        
        usage: 
        ```
        from compare_versions.compare_versions import compare_versions
        
        result = compare_versions('1.0.0.2.9', '1.0.0.3.4')
        
        # It will return:
        #     A positive number: If the first version is greater than the second  
        #     A negative number: If the first version is smaller than the second
        #     Zero: If the versions are equals
        ```
