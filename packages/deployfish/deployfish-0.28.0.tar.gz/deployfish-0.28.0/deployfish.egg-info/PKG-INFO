        To use ``deployfish``, you
        
        * Install ``deployfish``
        * Define your tasks and services in ``deployfish.yml``
        * Use ``deploy`` to start managing your tasks and services
        
        A simple ``deployfish.yml`` looks like this::
        
            services:
              - name: my-service
                environment: prod
                cluster: my-cluster
                count: 2
                load_balancer:
                  service_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123142123547:role/ecsServiceRole
                  load_balancer_name: my-service-elb
                  container_name: my-service
                  container_port: 80
                family: my-service
                network_mode: bridge
                task_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123142123547:role/myTaskRole
                containers:
                  - name: my-service
                    image: 123142123547.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-service:0.0.1

                    memory: 256
                    ports:
                      - "80"
                    environment:
                      - ENVIRONMENT=prod
                      - ANOTHER_ENV_VAR=value
                      - THIRD_ENV_VAR=value
