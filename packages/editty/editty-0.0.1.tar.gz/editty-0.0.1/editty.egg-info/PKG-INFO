Description: Editty
        ======
        
        Editty is a terminal-based non-linear editor for terminal recordings.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Source
        ~~~~~~
        
        When installing from source, it is recommended (but not required) to
        install Editty in a virtualenv.  To set one up::
        
          virtualenv --python=python3 editty-env
          source editty-env/bin/activate
        
        To install the latest version from pypi::
        
          pip install editty
        
        To install from a git checkout::
        
          pip install .
        
        In order to use the dissolve transition, you must run Editty in a
        256-color capable terminal, such as gnome-terminal or xterm.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installing Editty, you should be able to run it by invoking
        ``editty``.  If you installed it in a virtualenv, you can invoke it
        without activating the virtualenv with ``/path/to/editty-venv/bin/editty``.
        which you may wish to add to your shell aliases.  Use ``editty
        --help`` to see a list of command line options available.
        
        Once running, pressing the F1 key will show help text.
        
        Editty can load recordings in the formats produced by the ``script``
        and ``ttyrec`` commands.  It renders output in ``ttyrec`` format.
        
        Editty does not modify the original source files, but rather
        references them by path name.  Editty stores the edit decision list in
        its own JSON-based file format (use the ``.edit`` extension).
        
        To exit, press CTRL-q.
