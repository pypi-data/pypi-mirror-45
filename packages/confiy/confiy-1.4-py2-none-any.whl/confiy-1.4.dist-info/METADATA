# **confiy**

Confiy is easiest way to read config file only with key. 

#####Caution:
You must create a config file where you need to call, with any extension but .cnf is better and then write your configs in file such as following lines:

- my_prj
    - db
        - conf.cnf
        ```python
            key1=1234
            key2="string with value2"
            key3="string with value3"
        ```   
        - connector.py 
        ```python
            from confiy.confiy import confiy
            print(confiy().getValue(key='key1'))
        ```   

Easy to install and easier to use

Use python version >= 2.7
