  Explicitly mark Django 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 as not supported
  (tests fail with those versions) in packaging.

- Breaking: `django_anysign.api` package is no longer imported in
  `django_anysign` root package, as it is not compatible with Django 1.9.
  Instead of doing ``import django_anysign``, just do:
  ``from django_anysign import api as django_anysign``.

0.4 (2015-06-25)
----------------

Workaround identifiers and Django version.

- Features #7 and #8 - ``Signature`` and ``Signer`` models have
  ``anysign_internal_id`` attribute. It is an unique identifier for signature
  or signer on Django side. For use as a "foreign key" in backend's database,
  whenever possible. It defaults to an UUID. You may override it with a custom
  property if your models already have some UUID.

- Feature #5 - ``Signer`` model has ``signature_backend_id`` attribute. Use it
  to store the backend's signer identifier, i.e. signer's identifier in
  external database.

- Refactoring #15 - Project repository moved to github.com/novafloss (was
  github.com/novapost).

- Refactoring #18 - Tox runs tests for multiple Django version.

- Features #16 and #17 - Tests include Django version 1.7 and 1.8.
