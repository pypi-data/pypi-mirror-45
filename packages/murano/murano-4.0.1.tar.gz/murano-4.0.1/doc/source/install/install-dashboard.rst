Install Murano Dashboard
========================

Murano API & Engine services provide the core of Murano. However, your need a
control plane to use it. This section describes how to install and run Murano
Dashboard.

#.  Clone the murano dashboard repository.

    .. code-block:: console

       $ cd ~/murano
       $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/murano-dashboard
    ..

#.  Clone the ``horizon`` repository

    .. code-block:: console

       $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/horizon
    ..

#.  Create a virtual environment and install ``muranodashboard`` as an editable
    module:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ cd horizon
       $ tox -e venv -- pip install -e ../murano-dashboard
    ..

#.  Prepare local settings.

    .. code-block:: console

       $ cp openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py.example \
         openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py
    ..

    For more information, check out the official
    `horizon documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/>`_.

#.  Enable and configure Murano dashboard in the OpenStack Dashboard:

    * For Newton (and later) OpenStack installations, copy the plugin file,
      local settings files, and policy files.

      .. code-block:: console

         $ cp ../murano-dashboard/muranodashboard/local/enabled/*.py \
           openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/

         $ cp ../murano-dashboard/muranodashboard/local/local_settings.d/*.py \
           openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.d/

         $ cp ../murano-dashboard/muranodashboard/conf/* openstack_dashboard/conf/
      ..

    * For the OpenStack installations prior to the Newton release, run:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ cp ../murano-dashboard/muranodashboard/local/_50_murano.py \
           openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/
      ..

    Customize local settings of your horizon installation, by editing the
    :file:`openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py` file:

    .. code-block:: python

        ...
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = '*'

        # Provide OpenStack Lab credentials
        OPENSTACK_HOST = '%OPENSTACK_HOST_IP%'

        ...

        DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = DEBUG
    ..

    Change the default session back end-from using browser cookies to using a
    database instead to avoid issues with forms during the creation of
    applications:

    .. code-block:: python

        DATABASES = {
          'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
          'NAME': 'murano-dashboard.sqlite',
          }
        }

        SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'
    ..

#.  (Optional) If you do not plan to get the murano service from the keystone
    application catalog, specify where the murano-api service is running:

    .. code-block:: python

        MURANO_API_URL = 'http://%MURANO_IP%:8082'
    ..

#.  (Optional) If you have set up the database as a session back-end (this is
    done by default with the murano local_settings file starting with Newton),
    perform database migration:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ tox -e venv -- python manage.py migrate --noinput
    ..

#.  Run the Django server at 127.0.0.1:8000 or provide different IP and PORT
    parameters:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ tox -e venv -- python manage.py runserver <IP:PORT>
    ..

.. note::

   The development server restarts automatically following every code change.
..

**Result:** The murano dashboard is available at http://IP:PORT.
