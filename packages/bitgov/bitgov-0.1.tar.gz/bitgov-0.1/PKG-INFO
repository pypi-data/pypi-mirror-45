Description: # BitGov Protocol
        
        The BitGov protocol is an application layer protocol built with the Python socket module. It piggybacks on the layer four Transmission Control Protocol ([TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)) in combination with the [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) address family.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To use the BitGov protocol in your own application you may use one of the two methods listed below.
        
        ### Conda (recommended)
        
        Assuming you have [Anaconda installed](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), active the environment in which you want to install the package.
        
        ```
        conda activate <environment>
        ```
        
        If you want to create a new environment first use `conda create --name <environment>` or if you want to see a list of all your conda environments `conda info --envs`.
        
        Next, install the package.
        
        ```
        conda install -c jgphilpott bitgov
        ```
        
        **Note**: It may be necessary to first add the channel 'jgphilpott'. To do this use `conda config --add channels jgphilpott`. To view a list of all your conda channels `conda config --get channels`.
        
        All done! You should now be able to see the package listed in your environment `conda list`.
