# BitGov Protocol

The BitGov protocol is an application layer protocol built with the Python socket module. It piggybacks on the layer four Transmission Control Protocol ([TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)) in combination with the [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) address family.
