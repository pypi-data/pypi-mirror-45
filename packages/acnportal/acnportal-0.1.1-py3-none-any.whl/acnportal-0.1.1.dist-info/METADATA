# ACN Portal

The ACN Portal is a suite research tools developed at Caltech to accelerate the pace of large-scale EV charging research. 

### acndata
The Caltech Charging (C2) Dataset is a collection of EV charging sessions collected at Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This basic Python client simplifies the process of pulling data from his dataset via its public API.

### acnsim
acnsim is a simulation environment for large-scale EV charging algorithms. It interfaces with C2 to provide access to realistic test cases based on actual user behavior. 


### algorithms
algorithms is a package of common EV charging algorithms which can be used for comparison when evaluating new algorithms.
