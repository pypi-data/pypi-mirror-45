        py-gql is a pure python [GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/) implementation aimed at creating GraphQL servers.
        
        It supports:
        
        - Parsing the GraphQL query language and schema definition language.
        - Building a GraphQL type schema programatically and from Schema Definition files (including support for schema directives).
        - Validating and Executing a GraphQL request against a type schema.

        ## Installation
        
        ```.bash
        pip install py-gql
        ```
        
        For more details see [install.rst](docs/usage/install.rst).
        
        ## Usage & Examples
        
        ### Hello World
        
        ```.python
        from py_gql import build_schema, graphql_blocking
        
        schema = build_schema(
            """
            type Query {
                hello(value: String = "world"): String!
            }
            """
        )
        
        
        @schema.resolver("Query.hello")
        def resolve_hello(*_, value):
            return f"Hello {value}!"
        
        
        result = graphql_blocking(schema, '{ hello(value: "Foo") }')
        assert result.response() == {
            "data": {
                "hello": "Hello Foo!"
            }
        }
        ```
        
        For more usage examples, you can refer to the [User Guide](https://py-gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html) and some more involved examples available in the [examples](./examples) folder.
        
        The [tests](./tests) should also provide some contrived exmaples.
        
        ## Goals & Status
        
        This project was initially born as an experiment / learning project following some frustration with [graphql-core](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/) and [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/) I encountered at work.
        
        The main goals were originally to:
        
        - Get a deeper understanding of GraphQL
        - Provide an alternative to `graphql-core` which:
        
          - tracks the latest version of the spec (which `graphql-core` didn't)
          - does so without being a port of the JS code which leads to some weird edge case when we tried to extend the library
          - keeps support for Python 2 (which `graphql-core-next`) didn't (this isn't a focu anymore and version 0.2 dropped Python 2 support).
          - (subjective) attempts to be a bit more usable for our use cases, the ideal result would sit somewhere in between `Graphene` and `graphql-core`
          - makes it easier for us to build / include some extra tooling such as custom tracing, custom validation and SDL based tools as well as builder infrastructure to support easily implementing graphql layers over existing data layers (such as ORM).
        
        Not all these points are satisfied yet but py-gql should be ready for general use. It is however still in a fairly experimental phase and to reflect that versions are still in the `0.x.y`.The API is still subject to change as different part of the codebase are iterated on and are getting more use against production codebases.
        
        ## Development setup
        
        Make sure you are using Python 3.6+.
        
        Clone this repo and create a virtualenv before installing the development dependencies:
        
        ```.bash
        git clone git@github.com:lirsacc/py-gql.git
        python -m venv $WORKON_HOME/py-gql --copies
        pip install -U -r dev-requirements.txt
        ```
        
        From there, most development tasks are available through [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/).
        
        Use `inv -l` to list all available tasks and `inv {TASKS} --help` to get help on a specific task.
