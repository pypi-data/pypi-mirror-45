"""Seq to first iso: compute first isotopologues intensities from sequences.

Create a tsv file from a file of sequences.

Read a file composed of sequences of amino acids on each line and return :
    sequence,
    mass,
    normal formula and formula with unlabelled amino acids,
    M0 and M1 in normal and C[12] conditions
as a tsv file.

Unlabelled amino acids's carbons keep default isotopic abundance,
and are represented as X in formulas.
Naming conventions for isotopes follow pyteomics's conventions.
