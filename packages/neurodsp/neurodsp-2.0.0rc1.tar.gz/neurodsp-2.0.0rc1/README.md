A package of tools to process, analyze, and simulate neural time series, with specific focus on time and frequency domain analyses.

## Documentation

Documentation for the NeuroDSP module is available [here](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/).

The documentation also includes a full set of [tutorials](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/auto_tutorials/index.html)
covering the functionality of NeuroDSP.

If you have a question about using NeuroDSP that doesn't seem to be covered by the documentation, feel free to
open an [issue](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp/issues) and ask!

## Dependencies

NeuroDSP is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.5 to run.

It has the following dependencies:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- pytest (optional)

We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution to manage these requirements.
