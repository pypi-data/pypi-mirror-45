            These fields in the result object are customized for this expectation:
            ::

                {
                  "observed_value": (float) The true KL divergence (relative entropy) or None if the value is calculated \
                  as infinity, -infinity, or NaN
                  "details": {
                    "observed_partition": (dict) The partition observed in the data
                    "expected_partition": (dict) The partition against which the data were compared,
                                            after applying specified weight holdouts.
                  }
                }

            If the partition_object is categorical, this expectation will expect the values in column to also be \
            categorical.

                * If the column includes values that are not present in the partition, the tail_weight_holdout will be \
                equally split among those values, providing a mechanism to weaken the strictness of the expectation \
                (otherwise, relative entropy would immediately go to infinity).
                * If the partition includes values that are not present in the column, the test will simply include \
                zero weight for that value.

            If the partition_object is continuous, this expectation will discretize the values in the column according \
            to the bins specified in the partition_object, and apply the test to the resulting distribution.

                * The internal_weight_holdout and tail_weight_holdout parameters provide a mechanism to weaken the \
                expectation, since an expected weight of zero would drive relative entropy to be infinite if any data \
                are observed in that interval.
                * If internal_weight_holdout is specified, that value will be distributed equally among any intervals \
                with weight zero in the partition_object.
                * If tail_weight_holdout is specified, that value will be appended to the tails of the bins \
                ((-Infinity, min(bins)) and (max(bins), Infinity).

          If relative entropy/kl divergence goes to infinity for any of the reasons mentioned above, the observed value\
          will be set to None. This is because inf, -inf, Nan, are not json serializable and cause some json parsers to\
          crash when encountered. The python None token will be serialized to null in json.
