===================
Sale Delivery Rates
===================

This module extends the notion of delivery rate quotes introduced in
``stock_picking_rate`` to sale orders. The quotes are compatible with the
``Set price`` button on sale orders, which is used to calculate a delivery
price. Also, when a sale order with delivery rate quotes is confirmed and
generates a stock picking, the picking will be updated with equivalent quotes.

Usage
=====

Install and enjoy.

Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module expects each sale order to result in a single picking when
  confirmed and may produce incorrect results if multiple pickings are created
