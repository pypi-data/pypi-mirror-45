Warnings about unknown modules
==============================

We print warnings when we cannot find a module/package

    >>> from findimports import ModuleGraph

    >>> with open('marmalade.py', 'w') as f: _ = f.write('''
    ... import sys
    ... import os.path
    ... import email.Message as EM
    ... from . import foobar
    ... from io import StringIO
    ... from pickle import dumps as D
    ... from sys import (argv,
    ...                  exc_info as EI,
    ...                  exit)
    ... from email import *
    ... import imaginary.package
    ... ''')

    >>> graph = ModuleGraph()
    >>> graph.parseFile('marmalade.py')
    marmalade.py: could not find foobar
    marmalade.py: could not find imaginary.package
