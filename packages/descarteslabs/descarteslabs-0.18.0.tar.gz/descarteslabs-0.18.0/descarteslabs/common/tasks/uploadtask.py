class UploadTask(FutureTask):
    """
    An upload task which may or may not have completed yet. Accessing any
    attributes before the task is completed (for example ``status``)
    will block until the task completes.

    The upload process is two-phased. In the first phase, the input file is
    processed to extract features from the file. Errors parsing (invalid NDJSon
    or invalid GeoJson) will be captured in this phase. The features are then
    transformed into BigQuery inserts including sharding. In the second phase,
    the inserts are uploaded to BigQuery for processing. Once both phases
    have completed, the upload is considered done.

    If you want to check whether the attributes are available, use
    ``get_result()`` which will raise a ``TransientResultError`` if the
    attributes are not available yet.

    Upload tasks don't have a ``result`` or ``log`` attribute.

    Do not create an ``UploadTask`` yourself; it is returned by
    ``FeatureCollection.upload()`` and ``FeatureCollection.list_uploads()``.
