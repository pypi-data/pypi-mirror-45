        Install
        --------
        We're on the cheeseshop! Yay!
        
        `pip install pyborg`
        
        If you want the latest git via pip you'll need some special sauce.
        
        `pip install -e git+https://github.com/jrabbit/pyborg-1up.git#egg=pyborg\&subdirectory=pyborg`
        
        
        Note that we're using Python 3.6+ (for fancy type declarations) and 2.7 (for now)
        
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        `pyborg` is our new unified pyborg command line interface.

        Notes
        -----
        
        Pyborg is skipping version 1.3; this was used for a transitory database/"brain" restructuring that was underwhelming. 
        
        Ancient original tarballs were hosted at Gna! which is now gone. [Thankfully Internet Archive has a copy!](https://web.archive.org/web/20170225141934/http://download.gna.org/pyborg/) 
        
        Pyborg was originally developed by Tom Morton and Sébastien Dailly.
        
        
        Suggested NLTK data
        -------------------
        
        Pyborg can use nltk tagging and tokenizing when installed and configured. Tagging requires `averaged_perceptron_tagger` and tokenization requires `punkt`.
        
        
        Todo:
        -----
        
        * spelling or better heuristics
        * graphing and visualization of the database
