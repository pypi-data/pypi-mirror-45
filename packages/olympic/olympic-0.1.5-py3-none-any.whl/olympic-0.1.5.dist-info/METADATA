# Olympic PyTorch

Olympic implements a Keras-like API for PyTorch.

The goal of Olympic is to combine the joy of Pytorch's dynamic graph execution with the joy of Keras's high level abstractions
for training. Concretely, Olympic contains:

1. The ``olympic.fit()`` function. This implements a very similar API
    to Keras's ``model.fit`` and ``model.fit_generator`` methods in a
    more functional and less object-oriented fashion and spares you
    the effort of "hand-rolling" your own training loop.
2. ``Callback`` objects that perform functionality common to most deep
    learning training pipelines such as learning rate scheduling, model
    checkpointing and csv logging. These integrate into ``olympic.fit()``
    and spare you the effort of writing boilerplate code.
3. Some helpful utility functions such as common metrics and some
    convenience layers from Keras that are missing in PyTorch.

This package is available on PyPi.
