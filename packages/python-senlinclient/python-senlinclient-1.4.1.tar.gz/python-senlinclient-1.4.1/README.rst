Python bindings to the Senlin Clustering API
============================================

This is a client library for Senlin built on the Senlin clustering API. It
provides a Python API (the ``senlinclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``senlin``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`developer guide <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.
The master repository is in `Git <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-senlinclient>`_.
