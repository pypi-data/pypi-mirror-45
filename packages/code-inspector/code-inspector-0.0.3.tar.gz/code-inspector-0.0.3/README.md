# Code-Inspector Continuous Integration Tool

This is a Python tool used to trigger new analysis on [code-inspector](https://www.code-inspector.com)
in continuous integration pipeline.


## Build

You can build and try the program using the following command:

```bash
python setup.py install --user && $HOME/.local/bin/code-inspector
```

## Usage

You need to set your API keys with environment variables:

 * `CODE_INSPECTOR_ACCESS_KEY`: your access key API generated from your project preferences
 * `CODE_INSPECTOR_SECRET_KEY`: your secret key API generated from your project preferences

On a terminal, you would set them up like this:
```bash
export CODE_INSPECTOR_ACCESS_KEY=<INSERT-YOUR-API-ACCESS-KEY-HERE>
export CODE_INSPECTOR_SECRET_KEY=<INSERT-YOUR-API-SECRET-KEY-HERE>
```

Then, just invoke the tool as follow:

```python 
code-inspector
```

If a new build is triggered, the tool returns 0. If any issue occurs, it will return a non-zero value.

If you get non-zero return code and want to investigate, use the `-verbose` flag and invoke the tool as follow:

```python 
code-inspector --verbose
```
