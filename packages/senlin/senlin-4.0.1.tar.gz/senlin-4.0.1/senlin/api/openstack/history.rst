API Version History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document summarizes the changes made to the REST API with every bump of
API microversion. The description for each version should be verbose so that
it can be used by both users and developers.


1.1
---

 - This is the initial version of the v1 API which supports microversions.
   The v1.1 API is identical to that of v1.0 except for the new supports to
   microversion checking.

   A user can specify a header in the API request::

     OpenStack-API-Version: clustering <version>

   where the ``<version>`` is any valid API version supported. If such a
   header is not provided, the API behaves as if a version request of v1.0
   is received.

1.2
---

 - Added ``cluster_collect`` API. This API takes a single parameter ``path``
   and interprets it as a JSON path for extracting node properties. Properties
   values from all nodes are aggregated into a list and returned to users. 

 - Added ``profile_validate`` API. This API is provided to validate the spec
   of a profile without really creating a profile object.

 - Added ``policy_validate`` API. This API validates the spec of a policy
   without creating a policy object.

1.3
---

 - Added ``cluster_replace_nodes`` API. This API enables users to replace the
   specified existing nodes with ones that were not members of any clusters.

1.4
---

 - Added ``profile_type_ops`` API. This API returns a dictionary containing
   the operations and parameters supported by a specific profile type.

 - Added ``node_operation`` API. This API enables users to trigger an
   operation on a node. The operation and its parameters are determined by the
   profile type.

 - Added ``cluster_operation`` API. This API enables users to trigger an
   operation on a cluster. The operation and its parameters are determined by
   the profile type.

 - Added ``user`` query parameter for listing receivers.

 - Added ``destroy_after_deletion`` parameter for deleting cluster members.

1.5
---

   specified, the engine will check if the node is active before performing
   a recover operation.
