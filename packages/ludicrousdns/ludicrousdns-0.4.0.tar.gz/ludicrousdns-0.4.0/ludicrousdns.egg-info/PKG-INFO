        [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/sheddow/ludicrousdns/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sheddow/ludicrousdns/commits/master) [![coverage report](https://gitlab.com/sheddow/ludicrousdns/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sheddow/ludicrousdns/commits/master)
        
        Ludicrously speedy, infectious with the async. `ludicrousdns` is designed to be a cleaner, more accurate and more rate-limited version of [massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns). 
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install ludicrousdns
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        `ludicrousdns` can be used both as a library and a binary:
        ```python
        from ludicrousdns import ResolverPool
        r = ResolverPool()
        r.resolve_hosts(["example.com", "google.com"])
        ```
        or
        ```shell
        echo -e "example.com\ngoogle.com" > hosts.txt
        ludicrousdns resolve -d hosts.txt
        ```
        or simply
        ```shell
        echo -e "example.com\ngoogle.com" | ludicrousdns resolve
        ```
        
        ## Features
        - Rate-limited
        - Detects wildcard DNS
        - Ludicrously speedy
        
        ## TODO
        - Add benchmark to measure CPU- and network usage
        - Add benchmark to measure overall speed (use randomized subdomains to avoid effects of caching)
        - Add timeout to connections, for example with [async_timeout](https://github.com/aio-libs/async-timeout)
        - Add option to adjust rate-limiting
