        A pytest plugin that helps developers build successful test cases by providing
        them with GitHub commit information when their test cases fail.
        
        Basic Features
        --------------
        
        After ``pytest-blame`` has been successfully installed run pytest with
        the ``--track`` flag and you will see a report containing GitHub information at
        the top of your pytest report. ``pytest-blame`` will display the number of test
        cases that passed in the latest commit to GitHub, so you can compare it with your
        current rate.
        
        To run:
        As of now there isn't a way to see the output in a standard way.
        To run you need to copy the contents of ``pytest_blame.py`` over to ``tests/conftest.py``
        
        .. code-block::
        
           cp pytest_blame.py tests/conftest.py
        
        then running ``pytest --track tests/`` to see the output of the plugin.
        
        `Sample PyPI page <https://test.pypi.org/project/pytest-blame/>`_
        
        Install the most recent version of this plugin with
        
        .. code-block::
        
           pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pytest-blame
        
        Additional Features
        -------------------
        
        Read commits on GitHub and print out information since the most recent commit
        that passed test case.
