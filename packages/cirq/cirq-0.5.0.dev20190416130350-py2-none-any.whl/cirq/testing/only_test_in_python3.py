    u"""A decorator that indicates a test should not execute in python 2.

    For example, in python 2 repr('a') is "u'a'" instead of "'a'" when
    from __future__ import unicode is present (which it will be, since 3to2
    inserts it for us). This is annoying to work around when testing repr
    methods, so instead you can just tag the test with this decorator.
