@brief: A example that shows very brief all important features of the pynetworking module
@description:
This is example is meant to demonstrate the use of the most important features of the pynetworking module.
This example has to be adjusted if you want to implement a real client server application. Here client and
server are executed in the same process which is ok for testing but not realistic in reality.

"""

# define the address at which the server listen and the clients connect to
server_address = "127.0.0.1", 5000

# Only log errors

def main():
    # open and start the server and close afterwards
    with net.ClientManager(server_address, ClientCommunicator):
        # Connect a client to the server
        ServerCommunicator.connect(server_address, blocking=True, timeout=2)

        # Call functions at the server and print the return values
        ret = ServerCommunicator.remote_functions.greet_client()
        print(ret)

        ret = ServerCommunicator.remote_functions.say_hello("Doris")
        print(ret)

        ServerCommunicator.remote_functions.set_username("Jack")

        # Close the connection to the server at client-side
        ServerCommunicator.close_connection()

    # A class that defines every method that can be called at a client from the server
