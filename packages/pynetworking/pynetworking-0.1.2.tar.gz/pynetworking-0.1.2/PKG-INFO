Description: pynetworking
        ==============
        
        **High level network communication**
        
        This tool abstracts network communication to a level, where you don't have to care about
        network communication. Server side functions can be called at the client as they were local. Functions may be called
        with parameters and may return values.
        
        **NOTE:** This library is in development process. There may be big changes to it.
        
        Features
        --------
        - Directly call functions at the remote side
        - Get the return values
        - Don`t care about sockets
        
        Example
        ---------
        
        When you have setup everything this is an example how easy it will
        be to communicate between the server and client:
        
        At the *server:*
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           def add(number1, number2):
              return number1 + number2
        
        To call it at the *client:*
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           result = server.add(5, 10)
           print(result) # Output: 15

        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install is to use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           pip install pynetworking
        
        It is also possible to clone the repository from `Github <https://github.com/JulianSobott/networking>`_ with:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           git clone https://github.com/JulianSobott/networking.git
        
        Documentation
        --------------
        
        To view latest stable documentation goto: https://networking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        Or if you want the current documentation in a branch (e.g. dev), you can clone the repository,
        open the cmd and cd to the `docs` folder. You need `sphinx  <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ installed. Then
        you can type `make html` and see the local created docs.
        
        Getting started
        -----------------
        
        There is a `getting started <https://networking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external/Getting_started.html>`_ guide at the documentation. In this guide you will learn how to write a simple login application. This guide covers all basics, that are necessary. 
        
        If you are already familiar with this library and just need a brief recap, there is a `checklist <https://networking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external/Checklist.html>`_ for what you need in new projects.
