Overview
========
This module provides basic functionality that's often reinvented across
many of Zaber's scripts. It provides a unified configuration interface to
allow a single YAML file to hold information that can be used across 
multiple applications as well as generic tools to handle basic services
such as logging, email and templates.

Other modules such as izaber-cron will allow additional services such as
scheduled event and SQL support.

Documentation
=============
API documentation, usage and examples can be found in the "docs" directory.

Installation
============
The usual setup.py for Python libraries is used for the source distribution.

Packaging
