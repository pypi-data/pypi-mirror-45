Another revamp started. Purpuse is to conatain data and all associated
parameters in one class, and make more straighforward methods.

Old classes should be replaced by functions (mostly at least)
Deletions are not made at this point.

Core submodule should contain most basic io and recon things
New tests include:

test_core.py
test_core_write.py
