# Limmat

I sat by the river and thought about WSGI...


Limmat is yet another Python web framework building on top of WSGI. Limmat defines itself by the features it lacks.


## Lacking Features

- No request object
- No response object
- No template engine
- No built in WSGI server
- No router
- No Websocket support
- No plugin system
- No support for multiple apps or blueprints


## Formal Aims

- Single file library
- As small as possible
- Clean library namespace
- Thread-safe
- WSGI
