Description: # DEmoClassi
        DEmoClassi stands for **D**emographic (age, gender, race) and **Emo**tions 
        (happy, sad, angry, ...) **Classi**fication.
        
        This repository is an attempt to tackle the task of predicting the facial expression,
        age gender and race prediction from  facial images.
        
        As I was planning to train the models on Google Colab platform, I decided to gather 
        all my utility functions/classes in a package I named democlassi which is pip 
        installable via `pip install --upgrade democlassi`.
        
        The Training is done using Pytorch and pytorch-ignite and more 
        information about the data used, the training process and live prediction using 
        pretrained models and opencv can be found on 
        [this page](docs/pages.md).
