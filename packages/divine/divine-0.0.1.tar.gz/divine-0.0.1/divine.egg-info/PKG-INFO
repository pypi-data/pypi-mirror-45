Description: # Divine
        
        Divine is a configuration utility with unique features:
          - Ability to chain configs together, composing the whole from pieces
          - Ability to quickly grab a nested key using notation like
            c.get('abc/xyz/foo/bar')
          - Integrated f-strings for composable values and DRY patterns
          - Auto-callable config entries to instantiate a class or call a function with args and kwargs automatically from the config (yes, this is a security risk; don't parse any config from unknown sources)
        
        Divine accepts YAML or JSON files. It can be manually configured or auto-configured with an environment variable pointing to a config file. This allows for many processes to use the config without having to explicitly initialize the config in each process.
