class Simulation(Economy):
    r"""Simulation of synthetic data from BLP-type models.

    All data are either loaded or simulated during initialization, except for synthetic prices and shares, which are
    computed by :meth:`Simulation.solve`.

    Unspecified exogenous variables that are used to formulate product characteristics in :math:`X_1`, :math:`X_2`, and
    :math:`X_3`, as well as agent demographics, :math:`d`, are all drawn independently from the standard uniform
    distribution.

    Unobserved demand- and supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`, are drawn from a
    mean-zero bivariate normal distribution.

    After variables are loaded or simulated, any unspecified integration nodes and weights, :math:`\nu` and :math:`w`,
    are constructed according to a specified :class:`Integration` configuration.

    Next, traditional excluded BLP instruments are constructed. Demand-side instruments are BLP instruments constructed
    by :func:`build_blp_instruments` from :math:`X_1^x`, along with any supply shifters (variables in :math:`X_3` but
    not :math:`X_1`. Supply side instruments are BLP instruments constructed from :math:`X_3`, along with any demand
    shifters (variables in :math:`X_1` but not :math:`X_3`). BLP instruments for constant characteristics are
    constructed only if there is variation in :math:`J_t`, the number of products per market.

    .. note::

       These excluded instruments are constructed only for convenience. Especially for more complicated formulations,
       they should be replaced with better instruments. For example, instruments constructed with
       :func:`build_differentiation_instruments` may be preferable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_formulations : `tuple`
        Tuple of three :class:`Formulation` configurations for the matrix of linear product characteristics,
        :math:`X_1`, for the matrix of nonlinear product characteristics, :math:`X_2`, and for the matrix of cost
        characteristics, :math:`X_3`, respectively. If the formulation for :math:`X_2` is ``None``, the logit (or nested
        logit) model will be simulated.

        The ``shares`` variable should not be included in any of the formulations and ``prices`` should be included in
        the formulation for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2` (or both). All exogenous characteristics in :math:`X_2` should
        also be included in :math:`X_1`. Any additional variables that cannot be loaded from ``product_data`` will be
        drawn from independent standard uniform distributions. Unlike in :class:`Problem`, fixed effect absorption is
        not supported during simulation.

    beta : `array-like`
        Vector of demand-side linear parameters, :math:`\beta`. Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_1`, which
        is formulated by ``product_formulations``.
    sigma : `array-like`
        Cholesky root of the covariance matrix for unobserved taste heterogeneity, :math:`\Sigma`, which is an upper
        triangular matrix. Rows and columns correspond to columns in :math:`X_2`, which is formulated by
        ``product_formulations``. If the formulation for :math:`X_2` is ``None``, this should be ``None`` as well.
    gamma : `array-like`
        Vector of supply-side linear parameters, :math:`\gamma`. Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_3`, which
        is formulated by ``product_formulations``.
    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The convenience function
        :func:`build_id_data` can be used to construct the following required ID data:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with firms.

        Custom ownership matrices can be specified as well:

            - **ownership** : (`numeric, optional') - Custom stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership matrices,
              :math:`O`, for each market :math:`t`, which can be built with :func:`build_ownership`. By default,
              standard ownership matrices are built only when they are needed to reduce memory usage. If specified,
              there should be as many columns as there are products in the market with the most products. Rightmost
              columns in markets with fewer products will be ignored.

        .. note::

           If ``ownership`` has multiple columns, it can be specified as a matrix or broken up into multiple
           one-dimensional fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are three columns
           of ownership information, a ``ownership`` field with three columns can be replaced by three one-dimensional
           fields: ``ownership0``, ``ownership1``, and ``ownership2``.

        To simulate a nested logit or random coefficients nested logit (RCNL) model, nesting groups must be specified:

            - **nesting_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate products with nesting groups. When these IDs are
              specified, ``rho`` must be specified as well.

        Along with ``market_ids``, ``firm_ids``, and ``nesting_ids``, the names of any additional fields can typically
        be used as variables in ``product_formulations``. However, there are a few variable names such as ``'X1'``,
        which are reserved for use by :class:`Products`.

    agent_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for the matrix of observed agent characteristics called demographics,
        :math:`d`, which will only be included in the model if this formulation is specified. Any variables that cannot
        be loaded from ``agent_data`` will be drawn from independent standard uniform distributions.
    pi : `array-like, optional`
        Parameters that measure how agent tastes vary with demographics, :math:`\Pi`. Rows correspond to the same
        product characteristics as in ``sigma``. Columns correspond to columns in :math:`d`, which is formulated by
        ``agent_formulation``.
    agent_data : `structured array-like, optional`
        Each row corresponds to an agent. Markets can have differing numbers of agents. Since simulated agents are only
        used if there are nonlinear product characteristics, agent data should only be specified if :math:`X_2` is
        formulated in ``product_formulations``. If agent data are specified, market IDs are required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate agents with markets. The set of distinct IDs
              should be the same as the set in ``product_data``. If ``integration`` is specified, there must be at least
              as many rows in each market as the number of nodes and weights that are built for the market.

        If ``integration`` is not specified, the following fields are required:

            - **weights** : (`numeric, optional`) - Integration weights, :math:`w`, for integration over agent choice
              probabilities.

            - **nodes** : (`numeric, optional`) - Unobserved agent characteristics called integration nodes,
              :math:`\nu`. If there are more than :math:`K_2` columns (the number of nonlinear product characteristics),
              only the first :math:`K_2` will be used.

        The convenience function :func:`build_integration` can be useful when constructing custom nodes and weights.

        .. note::

           If ``nodes`` has multiple columns, it can be specified as a matrix or broken up into multiple one-dimensional
           fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are three columns of nodes, a
           ``nodes`` field with three columns can be replaced by three one-dimensional fields: ``nodes0``, ``nodes1``,
           and ``nodes2``.

        Along with ``market_ids``, the names of any additional fields can typically be used as variables in
        ``agent_formulation``. The exception is the name ``'demographics'``, which is reserved for use by
        :class:`Agents`.

    integration : `Integration, optional`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration over agent choice
        probabilities, which will replace any ``nodes`` and ``weights`` fields in ``agent_data``. This configuration is
        required if ``nodes`` and ``weights`` in ``agent_data`` are not specified. It should not be specified if
        :math:`X_2` is not formulated in ``product_formulations``.

        If this configuration is specified, :math:`K_2` columns of nodes (the number of nonlinear product
        characteristics) will be built. However, if ``sigma`` is left unspecified or is specified with columns fixed at
        zero, fewer columns will be used.

    rho : `array-like, optional`
        Parameters that measure within nesting group correlation, :math:`\rho`. If this is a scalar, it corresponds to
        all groups defined by the ``nesting_ids`` field of ``product_data``. If this is a vector, it must have :math:`H`
        elements, one for each nesting group. Elements correspond to group IDs in the sorted order of
        :attr:`Simulation.unique_nesting_ids`. If nesting IDs were not specified, this should not be specified either.
    xi : `array-like, optional`
        Unobserved demand-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi`. By default, each pair of unobserved characteristics
        in this and :math:`\omega` is drawn from a mean-zero bivariate normal distribution. This must be specified if
        ``omega`` is specified.
    omega : `array-like, optional`
        Unobserved supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\omega`. By default, each pair of unobserved
        characteristics in this and :math:`\xi` is drawn from a mean-zero bivariate normal distribution. This must be
        specified if ``xi`` is specified.
    xi_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of :math:`\xi`. The default value is ``1.0``. This is ignored if ``xi`` and ``omega`` are specified.
    omega_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of :math:`\omega`. The default value is ``1.0``. This is ignored if ``xi`` and ``omega`` are specified.
    correlation : `float, optional`
        Correlation between :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`. The default value is ``0.9``. This is ignored if ``xi`` and
        ``omega`` are specified.
    costs_type : `str, optional`
        Specification of the marginal cost function :math:`\tilde{c} = f(c)` in :eq:`costs`. The following
        specifications are supported:

            - ``'linear'`` (default) - Linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = c`.

            - ``'log'`` - Log-linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = \log c`.

    seed : `int, optional`
        Passed to :class:`numpy.random.RandomState` to seed the random number generator before data are simulated. By
        default, a seed is not passed to the random number generator.

        r"""Compute synthetic prices and shares.

        Prices and shares are computed in each market by iterating over the :math:`\zeta`-markup contraction in
        :eq:`zeta_contraction`:

        .. math:: p \leftarrow c + \zeta(p).

        .. note::

           To create a simulation under perfect (instead of Bertrand) competition, use an :class:`Iteration`
           configuration with ``method='return'``. This will set prices equal to the default starting values for the
           iteration routine, which are marginal costs.

        .. note::

           This method supports :func:`parallel` processing. If multiprocessing is used, market-by-market computation of
           prices and shares will be distributed among the processes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        firm_ids : `array-like, optional`
            Potentially changed firms IDs. By default, the ``firm_ids`` field of ``product_data`` in :class:`Simulation`
            will be used.
        ownership : `array-like, optional`
            Custom ownership matrices. By default, standard ownership matrices based on ``firm_ids`` will be used unless
            the ``ownership`` field of ``product_data`` in :class:`Simulation` was specified.
        prices : `array-like, optional`
            Prices at which the fixed point iteration routine will start. By default, marginal costs, :math:`c`, are
            used as starting values.
        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem. By default,
            ``Iteration('simple', {'atol': 1e-12})`` is used. Analytic Jacobians are not supported for solving this
            system.
        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle errors when computing prices and shares. For example, the fixed point routine may not converge
            if the effects of nonlinear parameters on price overwhelm the linear parameter on price, which should be
            sufficiently negative. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'raise'`` (default) - Raise an exception.

                - ``'warn'`` - Use the last computed prices and shares. If the fixed point routine fails to converge,
                  these are the last prices and shares computed by the routine. If there are other issues, these are the
                  starting prices and their associated shares.

        Returns
        -------
        `SimulationResults`
            :class:`SimulationResults` of the solved simulation.

        Examples
        --------
            - :doc:`Tutorial </tutorial>`
