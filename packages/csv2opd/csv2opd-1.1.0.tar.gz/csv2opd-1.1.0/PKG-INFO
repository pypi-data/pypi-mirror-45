Description: # CSV2OPD - A CSV to XML converter for OpenProdoc
        
        This desktop application transforms the metadata stored in a CSV file into XML files compatible with the open source DMS [OpenProdoc](https://github.com/JHierrot/openprodoc).
        
        This application was created by [Guillermo Castellano](https://guillearch.github.io/), from [Nosturi](https://nosturi.es/).
        
        The code is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/guillearch/atom-installer/blob/master/LICENSE). Feel free to adapt the application for your specific needs!
        
        ## Requirements
        
        This application can be used on any operating system which supports Python 3.x.
        
        Check if you have Python 3.x installed by entering the following command into your terminal:
        
        ```
        python --version
        ```
        
        You should see something like this:
        
        ```
        $ python --version
        Python 3.7.0
        ```
        
        Otherwise, [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before moving forward.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to download and install CSV2OPD is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
        
        ```
        pip install csv2opd
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can clone this repository:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/guillearch/csv2opd.git
        ```
        
        Then go to the new directory and run:
        
        ```
        # If Python 3 is the default version
        python setup.py install
        
        # If Python 2 is the default version
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Running the application
        
        1. Run the application by entering the following command: `csv2opd`.
        2. Select the input CSV file. It must have a header.
        3. Select the output directory for the XML files.
        4. Select the type of field separator (delimiter) used by your CSV file.
        5. Click the button Convert.
        
        Once the conversion is completed, you can import the documents and the metadata into OpenProdoc following the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://jhierrot.github.io/openprodoc/help/EN/ImpExpFold.html).
        
        We're all set!
        
         **Important**: The name of each document must be the same than the value of the Name field on its related OPD file.
        
        ## Additional information
        
        This application is intended for OpenProdoc 2.x.
