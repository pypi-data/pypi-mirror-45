        Basic notebook smoke tests: Do they run ok? Do they contain lint?
        
        **WARNING: early stage proof of concept; work in progress. Use at your
        own risk.**
        
        In particular, this extension is supposed to handle ipython magics as
        far as possible, but has not yet been widely tested.
        
        ----
        
        This `Pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `Cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install nbsmoke via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::
        
            $ pip install nbsmoke
        
        Or you can install nbsmoke via `conda`_ from `anaconda.org`_::
        
            $ conda install -c pyviz/label/dev -c conda-forge nbsmoke
            
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Check all notebooks run without errors::
        
            $ pytest --nbsmoke-run
        
        Check all notebooks run without errors, and store html to look at
        afterwards::
        
            $ pytest --nbsmoke-run --store-html=/scratch
        
        Lint check notebooks::
        
            $ pytest --nbsmoke-lint
        
        Instead of all files in a directory, you can specify a list e.g.::
        
            $ pytest --nbsmoke-run notebooks/Untitled*.ipynb
        
        If you want to restrict pytest to running only your notebook tests, use `-k`, e.g.::
        
            $ pytest --nbsmoke-run -k ".ipynb"
            
        Additional options are available by standard pytest 'ini'
        configuration in setup.cfg, pytest.ini, or tox.ini::
        
            [pytest]
            # when running, seconds allowed per cell (see nbconvert timeout)
            nbsmoke_cell_timeout = 600
        
            # notebooks to skip running; one case insensitive re to match per line
            nbsmoke_skip_run = ^.*skipme\.ipynb$
                               ^.*skipmetoo.*$
        
            # case insensitive re to match for file to be considered notebook;
            # defaults to ``^.*\.ipynb``
            it_is_nb_file = ^.*\.something$
        
        nbsmoke supports ``# noqa`` comments to mark that something
        should be ignored during lint checking.
        
        The ``nbsmoke_skip_run`` list in a project's config can be ignored by
        passing ``--ignore-nbsmoke-skip-run`` (useful if sometimes you want to
        run all notebooks).
        
        
        What's the point?
        -----------------
        
        Although more sophisticated testing of notebooks is possible (e.g. see
        nbval), just checking that notebooks run from start to finish without
        error in a fresh kernel (or on a neutral CI service) can be useful
        during development. Practical experience of working on several
        projects with notebooks confirms this, but that's all the evidence I
        have.
        
        Checking notebooks for lint might seem trivial/pointless, but it
        frequently uncovers unused names (typically unused imports). It's also
        quite common to find python 2 vs 3 problems, and sometimes undefined
        names - in a way that's faster than running the notebook (over
        multiple versions of python).
        
        Unused imports/names themselves might seem trivial, but they can
        hinder understanding of a notebook by readers, or add dependencies
        that are not required.
        
        Using ``# noqa: explanation`` in a notebook might seem like overkill,
        but the intention is to at least force 'mysterious imports' to be
        clarified (if they are necessary at all, which ideally they shouldn't
        be). E.g. if you're importing something for its side effects, it's
        very helpful to inform the reader of that, and the ugly/strange ``#
        noqa`` should help remind you to fix the underlying problem...
        
        Pyflakes is used as the underlying linter because "Pyflakes makes a
        simple promise: it will never complain about style, and it will try
        very, very hard to never emit false positives."

        ------------
        
        First, install using ``pip install -e .``. Then run the tests using
        ``tox`` or ``pytest -v tests/``.
        
        New release to PyPI and anaconda.org: ``git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m
        "Something about release" && git push --tags``.
