Description: # ntai
        ntai stands for nucleotide (nt) artificial intelligence (A.I.). ntai is a small
        python library for using fasta sequences with artificial intelligence (A.I.).
        
        Currently there are two main modules that will be of use
        
        1. `Codex`, and
        2. `bedtools`
        
        ## Codex
        `Codex` is a class for hot-encoding fasta sequences into channels and back.
        `Codex` is useful because a character in a fasta sequences can encode multiple
        nucleotides or even random repeats.
        
        ## bedtools
        
        `bedtools` is a function exposing the `bedtools` library to python. This allows
        users to extract fasta sequences from a reference genome with writing to /
        reading from files.
