Description: # ACT Workers
        
        ## Introduction
        
        This repository contains workers for the [ACT platform](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-platform).
        
        The source code the workers are available on [github](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-workers).
        
        # Setup
        
        To use the workers, install from PyPi:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip3 install act-workers
        ```
        
        This will install scripts for all workers:
        
        * act-attack
        * act-country-regions
        * act-misp-feeds
        * act-mnemonic-pdns
        * act-scio
        * act-shadowserver-asn
        * act-vt
        * act-uploader
        
        ## Requirements
        
        All workers requires python version >= 3.5 and the act-api library:
        
        * [act-api](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-api-python) (act-api on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/act-api/))
        
        In addition some of the libraries might have additional requirements. See requirements.txt for a full list of all requirements.
        
        # Local development
        
        Use pip to install in [local development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs). act-workers (and act-api) uses namespacing, so it is not compatible with using `setup.py install` or `setup.py develop`.
        
        In repository, run:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install --user -e .
        ```
