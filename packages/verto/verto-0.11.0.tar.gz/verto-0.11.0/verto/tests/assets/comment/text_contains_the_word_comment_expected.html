<p>Now go back and have another conversation with Eliza. There are many other examples of Eliza saying stuff that makes no sense such as the above dialogue. How many can you find? In addition, how does Eliza respond when you do the following things?</p>
<ul>
<li>Try being a "parrot" that just copies everything Eliza says.</li>
<li>What happens when you don’t give meaningful answers to her questions?</li>
<li>If you say the same thing you said earlier in the conversation, does Eliza always respond in the same way? (When you say it immediately after, she probably won’t, as she’ll comment on the fact that you repeated yourself the second time!)</li>
<li>What happens when you talk about things that are unrelated to what would be said in a therapy session, i.e. you try to have a general conversation with Eliza (remember that Eliza works in a restricted domain, i.e. she assumes she is a therapist).</li>
</ul>
