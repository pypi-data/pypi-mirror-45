<p>Next we examine a simple system for reading input called a <a class="glossary-term" data-glossary-term="finite-state-automaton" id="glossary-finite-state-automaton">finite state automaton</a>, which --- as we'll find out later --- is closely related to <a class="glossary-term" data-glossary-term="regular-expression">regular expressions</a>.
Later we'll explore the idea of <a class="glossary-term" data-glossary-term="grammar">grammars</a>, another kind of formal language that can deal with more complicated forms of input.</p>
