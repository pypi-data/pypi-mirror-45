<p>The most precise way of giving a set of instructions is in the form of a <a class="glossary-term" data-glossary-term="algorithm" id="glossary-algorithm">program</a>, which is a specific implementation of an algorithm, written in a specific programming language, with a very specific result for any particular input.</p>
<p>Because algorithms exist even if they aren't turned in to programs, we won't need to look at programs at all for this topic, unless you particularly want to.</p>
