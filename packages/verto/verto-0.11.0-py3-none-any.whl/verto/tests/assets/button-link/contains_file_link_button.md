The following interactive has a program that solves the problem for however many cities you want to select by trying out all possible routes, and recording the best so far.  You can get a feel for what an intractable problem looks like by seeing how long the interactive takes to solve the problem for different size maps.
Try generating a map with about 5 cities, and press "Start" to solve the problem.

Now try it for 10 cities (twice as many). Does it take twice as long? How about twice as many again (20 cities)? What about 50 cities? Can you guess how long it would take?
You're starting to get a feel for what it means for a problem to be *intractable*.
