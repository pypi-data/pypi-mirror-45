<p>The next interactive allows you to do translation (using a vector).
Use it to get used to translating in the three dimensions (don't worry about using matrices this time.)</p>

In 2D rotations were around the centre (origin) of the grid, but in 3D rotations are around a line (either the horizontal x-axis, the vertical y-axis, or the z-axis, which goes into the screen!)</p>
<p>The 2D rotation we used earlier can be applied to 3 dimensions using this matrix:</p>

The following interactive can do those calculations for you.</p>
<p>For example, in the following interactive, type in the matrix for doubling the size of an object (put the number 2 instead of 1 on the main diagonal values), then add another matrix that triples the size of the image (3 on the main diagonal). The interactive shows a matrix on the right that combines the two --- does it look right?</p>
