<p>For a fun discussion, you could have the students look at the <a href="http://www.cs4fn.org/linguistics/klingon.html">Klingon Linguistics activity at CS4FN</a>. This page introduces the fundamentals of languages â€” words (the alphabet) and <a class="glossary-term" data-glossary-term="grammar">grammar</a> (the rules of syntax). It discusses why languages are translated and how meaning can be changed by translation. It also explains why computer languages need to be translated.</p>
