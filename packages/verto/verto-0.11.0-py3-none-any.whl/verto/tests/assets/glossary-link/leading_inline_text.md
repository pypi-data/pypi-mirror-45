For a fun discussion, you could have the students look at the [Klingon Linguistics activity at CS4FN](http://www.cs4fn.org/linguistics/klingon.html). This page introduces the fundamentals of languages â€” words (the alphabet) and {glossary-link term="grammar"}grammar{glossary-link end} (the rules of syntax). It discusses why languages are translated and how meaning can be changed by translation. It also explains why computer languages need to be translated.
