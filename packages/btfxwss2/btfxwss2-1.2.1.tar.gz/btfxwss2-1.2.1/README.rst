BTFXWSS
=======

Client for Bitfinex Websocket API written in Python

Currently supports all public endpoints; authenticated channels are a
work in progress.

Offers graceful exception handling of common server errors.

Data is stored within `BtfxWss` as `Queue`s. There are convenience
methods available to retrieve a queue for a given type. Consult
the code for more documentation.

Please note that you must take care of handling data in the queues yourself!
Not doing so will eventually result in `MemoryError`s, since the queues
do not have a maximum length defined.

Installation
------------

Via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install btfxwss

Usage
-----

Starting a session and subscribing to channels.

.. code-block:: python

    from btfxwss import BtfxWss
    
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='test.log')
    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    fh = logging.FileHandler('test.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    sh = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    sh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    log.addHandler(sh)
    log.addHandler(fh)
    
    wss = BtfxWss()
    wss.start()
    while not wss.connection.is_connected.is_set():
        time.sleep(1)
    
    # Subscribe to some channels
    wss.subscribe_to_ticker('BTCUSD')
    wss.subscribe_to_order_book('BTCUSD')
    
    # Send a ping - if this returns silently, everything's fine.
    wss.ping()
    
    # Do something else
    t = time.time()
    while time.time() - t < 10:
        pass


Accessing data stored in BtfxWss:

.. code-block:: python

    ticker_q = wss.tickers('BTCUSD')  # returns a Queue object for the pair.
    while not ticker_q.empty():
        print(ticker_q.get())


Unsubscribing from channels:

.. code-block:: python

    wss.ticker('BTCUSD', unsubscribe=True)
    wss.ticker('BTCEUR', unsubscribe=True)


Shutting down the client:

.. code-block:: python

    wss.stop()

A big thanks to the devs providing the websocket-client_ library,
as well ekulyk for providing the `PythonPusherClient`, which I used as a reference
for the connection class. And finally, a big thanks to all the people submitting
issues, discussing solutions and simply starring the project - you all help me
stay excited and motivated for this project! Cheers to you.
