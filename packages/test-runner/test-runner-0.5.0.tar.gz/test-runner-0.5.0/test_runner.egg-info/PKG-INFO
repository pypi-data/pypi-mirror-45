Description: 
        # test-runnerâ€”A Runner for Python Tests
        
        Running Python tests is a complicated task, as it seems that there is not
        standard way of doing it.
        `test-runner` implements some heuristics that try to run tests with or without
        coverage measuring, independent of the used testing framework.
