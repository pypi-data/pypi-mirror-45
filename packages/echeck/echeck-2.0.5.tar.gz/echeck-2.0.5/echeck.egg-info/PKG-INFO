        ## What can ECHECK do?
        
        * Echeck is a scripting tool developed based on the Python language. It mainly includes four core commands: eping, escan, ecurl, and eshell.
        * [ecurl](#2) is the same as curl instructions, it can try to access multiple addresses at the same time and output results
        * [eping](#3) can ping multiple service addresses at the same time and output results
        * [escan](#4) is a port sniffing tool, and ultimately returns the result of port sniffing
        * [eshell](#5) instructions can be executed remotely
        
        ## Use of ECHECK
        
        ### Installation
        
        > ECHECK is based on Python 3.7. You need to install python3 before installing the tool.
        
        #### 1. Install Python3
        
        > The development of the tool is based on Python version 3.7. It has not been tested for compatibility. Try to install version 3.7 when using it.
        * Python3 download
        
        > [Python download address](https://www.python.org)
        
        * Select the corresponding version to install
        ```
        $ curl -Ok  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tgz
        $ tar -xzvf Python-3.7.3.tgz
        $ cd Python-3.7.3
        $ ./configure
        $ make && make install
        ```
        
        #### 2. Install pip
        
        * Download the installation script
        ```
        $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
        ```
        * Execute the installation instructions
        
        ```
        $ python get-pip.py
        ```
        
        #### 3. Install virtualenv
        
        > It is recommended to use virtualenv to simplify the impact of the external environment on the tool installation. If it is linux or mac, you can use the following command to install it.
        ```
        $ pip install virtualenv
        ```
        > Executable help to view the virtualenv use instructions
        #### 4. Create a virtual environment
        ```
        $ virtualenv -p 'specify python installation path' venv
        ```
        #### 5. Activate the virtual environment
        ```
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        #### 6. Install ECHECK
        
        > Before installing ECHECK, you need to install pycurl&gt;=7.43.0.2
        
        * Install pycurl
        
        __Make sure that openssl is installed before installing pycurl. For how to install openssl, it will be explained in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section.__
        ```
        $ export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl
        $ pip install pycurl
        
        ```
        
        * Source code installation
        
        > Download source code
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/rockyCheung/easy_echeck.git
        ```
        > Execute the installation instructions
        ```
        $ cd easy_echeck
        $ python setup.py install
        
        ```
        * Installed with pip
        
        ```
        $ pip install echeck
        ```
        
        ### How to use
        #### 1. Profile conf.yml
        > Conf.yml is the core configuration file, below is a simple example
        ```
        #yaml config
        #服务器的基础配置
        server:
            log:

        > * CryptographyDeprecationWarning: encode_point has been deprecated on EllipticCurvePublicNumbers and will be removed in a future version. Please use EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes to obtain both compressed and uncompressed point encoding.
        > * CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Support for unsafe construction of public numbers from encoded data will be removed in a future version. Please use EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point

        > * CryptographyDeprecationWarning: encode_point has been deprecated on EllipticCurvePublicNumbers and will be removed in a future version. Please use EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes to obtain both compressed and uncompressed point encoding.

        > __Solution Perform before installing:__
        ```
        $ export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl
        $ pip install pycurl
        ```

            ----------------------------------------
        
        ```
        > Solution install openssl
        
        __Execute the following command under mac__
        ```
        $ brew install openssl
        ```
        __Because considering that users may use TLS, brew will not be set as the default preferred module when installing openssl, so in order to find openssl when using or compiling, you need to make the following settings:__
        
        ```markdown
        $ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
        $ source ~/.bash_profile
        $ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
        $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
        $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
        
        ```
        __Then execute the pycurl installation instructions__
        ```markdown
        $ export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl
        $ pip install pycurl
        ```
        > * Install openssl
        
        __Openssl installation on windows is more complicated, it is best to find the latest version of openssl exe installation package online before installation.__
        
        ## Release notes
        
        * Version 2.0.2
        > 1. In order to facilitate the identification of the device and enhance the identification of the device, the label setting is added to the eshell and escan commands, and the user can identify the device by the user according to the actual needs.
        > 2. In this version, the instructions for use and the handling of common errors are added.
