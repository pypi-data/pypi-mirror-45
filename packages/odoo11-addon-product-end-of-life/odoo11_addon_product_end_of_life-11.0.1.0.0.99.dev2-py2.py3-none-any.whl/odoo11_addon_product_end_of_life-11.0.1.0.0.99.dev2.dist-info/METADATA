=================================================
Product alert when close to End-of-Life(Eol) Date
=================================================

This module allows you to set the End of Life Date of a Product.

Products with EoL Date in the past are excluded from the list of Products in Purchase Order so the product can not be ordered.

A scheduled action is created to know in advance the list of products whose EoL Date is approaching.
An email will be sent to the members of the Discussion Channel for Product Eol Notification Group.

Configuration

---------------

* Look for the the Private Channel > Product End-Of-Life Channel.

Scheduled Action
----------------

  if a product is about to reach its end-of-life
* The interval is automatically configured using the notification delay setting

  can be configured in Inventory > Configuration > Settings
