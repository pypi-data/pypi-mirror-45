"""A library for finding approximate subsequence matches.

Contains several implementations of fuzzy sub-sequence search functions. Such
functions find parts of a sequence which match a given sub-sequence up to a
given maximum Levenshtein distance.

The simplest use is via the find_near_matches utility function, which chooses
a suitable fuzzy search implementation based on the given parameters.

Example:
>>> find_near_matches('PATTERN', 'aaaPATERNaaa', max_l_dist=1)
[Match(start=3, end=9, dist=1)]
