"""The module contains functions and classes for building iterative
reconstruction applications for MRI.

It provides convenient simulation and sampling functions,
such as poisson-disc sampling function, and shepp-logan
phantom generation function. It also implements common
MRI reconstruction applications, including SENSE reconstruction,
l1-wavelet reconstruction, total-variation reconstruction,
and JSENSE reconstruction.
