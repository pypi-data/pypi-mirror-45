Description: Hattifnatt watches a directory for changes and creates, updates or
        deletes files in a Telegram channel accordingly.  File digests and
        message IDs are persisted in a state file (named ``.hat``), so even
        updates that occur when the watcher is not running will be pushed
        correctly.  Note that Telegram will sometimes corrupt the file names on
        upload; this will not break anything, but cannot be fixed by this tool,
        either.  Any Telegram chat could theoretically be used---not necessarily
        a channel---but the bot API limits deletion of old messages in personal
        chats.
        
        A single command-line tool is provided, ``hat``, that watches the
        current directory, reads the Telegram bot token from the environment
        variable TOKEN, the Telegram chat ID from the environment variable CHAT,
        and the glob patterns to watch from the command-line arguments (all
        files are watched by default).  The tool can be stopped by ^C.
        
        Alternatively, the function ``hattifnatt.push(chat, patterns)`` performs
        the same function programmatically.  It accepts ``chat``, a
        ``telegram.Chat`` object (obtained from ``telegram.Bot.get_chat``), and
        a list of glob patterns.  For now it does not support pushing
        directories other than the current one.
